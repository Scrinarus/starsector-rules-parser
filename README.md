Scrinarus's Starsector Rules.CSV Parser

The goal of this project is short and simple - convert the rules.csv file (and potentially other files in the future) within Starsector into formats that are both easily human readable, and more importantly, citeable, to better allow discussion surrounding the writing.

To this end, this python script takes an existing rules.csv file and tears out the text presented to the player, alongside the dialogue flags leading up to and being created from any given dialogue, and formats them with relevant csv line numbers in a plain text format.

This project is not designed to replace the base game - there is too much context lost by using this tool alone to appreciate the whole work - nor is it designed to be used to develop mods - there are much better and more complete rules.csv editors in the community to do that job.
