[Line 14] A silent ring of adamantine material, derelict of a former age.
The Gate is inert.

[Line 15] Before you vast and potent hangs an adamantine ring, derelict of a former age.
You have scanned this Gate and discovered the rhythm of the secret heart of the thing, hidden in a slip of space. Using the Janus Device to create a bridge to another Gate requires a massive quantity of fuel. The more distant the target, the more fuel is required.
The Janus Device operates by transferring enormous amounts of peculiarly phased energy via a lead ship's hyperdrive field to stabilize a direct gate-to-gate connection.

[Line 16] Before you vast and potent hangs an adamantine ring, derelict of a former age.
You have scanned this Gate and discovered the rhythm of the secret heart of the thing, hidden in a slip of space. Using the Janus Device to create a bridge to another Gate requires a massive quantity of fuel. The more distant the target, the more fuel is required.
You must integrate the Janus Device into your fleet to use the Gate.

[Line 17] A silent ring of adamantine material, derelict of a former age.
Your sensors officer nods to your cue. Your command interface lights up. 'EXECUTE SCAN' blinks expectantly. The Gate awaits, as cold as a tomb.

[Line 18] A silent ring of adamantine material, derelict of a former age.
You have scanned this Gate and discovered the rhythm of the secret heart of the thing, hidden in a slip of space.

[Line 19] A silent ring of adamantine material, derelict of a former age.
Your sensors officer nods to you; the hyperwave scanner is ready. The words 'EXECUTE SCAN' blink expectantly in your command interface.
You will need a scan of this Gate to be able to use it, with the Janus Device, as an access or egress point from the Gate network.

[Line 20] You order your $shipOrFleet to traverse the dead gateway. Your bridge crew is especially quiet during the passage.
Nothing happens.

[Line 21] Your command display is overlaid with a representation of the hyperspace manifold surrounding the Gate. It is calm and cool, devoid of drive-wakes.
As the scan begins you watch a line of disruption flare between the icon representing your flagship and the icon representing the Gate. Spirals and ripples spill out in non-Newtonian waves, surging from a point at the center of the Gate. No, it's not a point - a circle, a sphere, a torus and inverted funnel; then some other form that makes you squeeze your eyes shut. You hear faint music from far away.
"Captain?" Your sensors officer is looking at you, "The scan is complete." You realize it's the second time they said this, and you gesture as if you were simply lost in thought.

[Line 22] Your command display shows a representation of the hyperspace manifold. It is calm and cool.
The scan begins, a line of disruption flaring between your flagship and the Gate. Spirals and ripples spill and surge in non-Newtonian bursts from a point at the center of the Gate. No, not a point - a circle, a sphere, a torus and inverted funnel; then some geometry that does not parse.
You hear the faint music.
"Captain," your sensors officer reports, "The scan is complete."

[Line 23] Your command display shows the hyperspace manifold. It is calm and cool.
The scanning beam flares in the hyperdimensional display. Spirals and ripples spill in bursts from the Gate, surging into inconceivable geometry. You hear a wisp of faint music.
"Captain," your sensors officer reports, "The scan is complete."

You personally see off the party of Luddic faithful who maintained vigil from your flagship. Their fleet is returning; their collective devotion uninterrupted.
"Blessings of Ludd upon you, captain," says their leader. "I shall speak well of you to the Prophet Returned."
You know to nod in acceptance without raising any theological questions, and give a polite wave as their shuttle leaves the bay.

Abyssal Lights
------------------------------
[Line 62] A cold light fills the viewscreen, stark against the utter darkness of the hyperspace abyss. It seems to pulse, shifting dimmer and then brighter, following no discernable pattern. It does not flicker like a flame, nor like a failing comms signal, but like... something at the edge of your consciousness. It is...
You find you are able to anticipate the rhythm, more seen than heard, the dancing light filling your vision...
A polite cough from your sensors officer brings you back to the present. "$PlayerSirOrMadam?"

[Line 63] The cold light fills the viewscreen, stark against the abyss. The subtle pulse of the light begs for attention, but gives no promise of comfort.
You give your head half a shake, centering your attention on your bridge officers to give your next order.

[Line 64] [Options Given: abyssalLight_what:"Sensors, what are we looking at?"]

[Line 65] [Options Given: abyssalLight_askOps:"Ops. Is there a problem?"]

[Line 66] [Options Given: defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 67] [Option Selected: "Sensors, what are we looking at?"]
"It's an abyssal light, $playerSirOrMadam."
Your sensors officer quickly realizes that this statement is as obvious as it is unilluminating.
"And. We don't know exactly what it... is. There's fragmentary pre-Collapse data. Some academicians speculate that it might be a spontaneous buildup of dark energy, maybe, around a temporary hyperspace quasistructure, a sort of knot in higher dimensions that alters the physical effects of... whatever it is."
You catch your ops chief making the spacer hand-sign for 'all seals confirmed safe', a sort of ward against evil.

[Line 67] [Options Given: abyssalLight_what2:Continue]

[Line 68] [Option Selected: Continue]
"They're not known, um, to be dangerous," your sensors officer continues, tapping at the console. "The drive field should keep us safe."
"It does appear to be highly unstable. They always are, and they're difficult to properly scan. I think if we tried an active scan or fired off an interdiction pulse it would collapse; the resulting discharge might allow us to chart local hyperspace topography."

[Line 69] [Option Selected: "Ops. Is there a problem?"]
Your ops chief, normally unflappable, almost flinches.
"$PlayerSirOrMadam. No, $playerSirOrMadam."
You let the silence linger, letting ops know that denial is not enough of an answer.
"Captain." Ops looks at you directly. "It's said to be... bad luck to meddle with things this deep in hyperspace." Ops stands up straighter, "I've no technical opinion; I raise the point only as a matter of crew morale. Mere dockside superstition, I'm sure."

[Line 69] [Options Given: abyssalLight_askOpsOutA:"Understood, I'll be mindful. Thank you chief."
abyssalLight_askOpsOutB:"Such superstition has no place on my bridge, is that understood?"]

[Line 70] [Option Selected: "Understood, I'll be mindful. Thank you chief."]
"$PlayerSirOrMadam," your ops chief says, then turns back to the main display, determined to make nothing more of it.

[Line 71] [Option Selected: "Such superstition has no place on my bridge, is that understood?"]
"Understood, $playerSirOrMadam." Your ops chief turns back to the main display, determined to make nothing more of it.

Abyssal Light - Shrouded Dweller
------------------------------
[Line 74] Cold light fills the primary display, stark against the abyss. The subtle pulse begs for your attention yet offers no promise of comfort.
After a moment you consciously pull your eyes from the pitiless sight, centering your attention on your bridge officers to give your next order.

[Line 74] [Options Given: abyssalLight_dwellerCont:Continue]

[Line 75] Cold light begins to grow in the primary display. A subtle pulse begs for your attention.
"Captain, I-" It's your navigation officer, who glances at sensors and receives a nod. "The light is moving. Coming closer."
You consciously pull your eyes from that comfortless light - diminished but not bereft of its call through even the meager medium of the primary display.
It's come to you.

[Line 75] [Options Given: abyssalLight_dwellerCont:Continue]

[Line 76] [Option Selected: Continue]
"$PlayerSirOrMadam!" Your sensors officer's voice is strained. "Picking up - from the light - they came from out of nowhere!" 
Navigation interrupts, "$ShipOrFleet drive bubble in the red, instability increasing... holding... alert to multiple penetrations. N-space fissures detected inside the volume."
A pause as the bridge crew takes in the eruption of alerts on their displays. Tactical takes initiative and activates the combat alarm to send all crew to battle stations. Frantic activity from all posts, chatter between the stations coordinating response.
Sensors calls over the low din: "It's homing in on our active sensor emissions."

[Line 76] [Options Given: abyssalLight_maxSensors:Order a sensor sweep, full power, focused on the anomalous drive-bubble penetrations
abyssalLight_wait:Wait
abyssalLight_emCon:"Go to maximum emission control! EMCON zero-zero alpha, immediate execute."]

[Line 77] [Option Selected: Order a sensor sweep, full power, focused on the anomalous drive-bubble penetrations]
"Aye $playerSirOrMadam! Executing." Sensors barks, then deftly executes a series of overrides. 
Your $shipOrFleet status is up on the central display - shield bubble an unsteady amber, incursions of N-space fissures marked in garish red. A blink of white as active sensors trigger and-
-pressure on the drive bubble spikes, an amber flash, a cacophony of alarms...
* * *
A hidden blackness waiting, lurking, jolts awake. Tendrils lunge eagerly, hungrily, through fissures in the dark behind the night.

[Line 78] [Option Selected: "Go to maximum emission control! EMCON zero-zero alpha, immediate execute."]
At your command, the unperceived chorus of a multitude of ship systems and machinery dies down with a deepening sigh into muted quietude.
All that remains is the breath and bodies of your bridge crew, a strange assertion of your shared humanity. 
Backup e-lighting, simple chemical things, provide an eerie glow. A series of dimly pulsing commands illuminate your executive interface - a flock of ardent subsystems ready to awaken from minimum operation at your touch.
* * *
A hidden blackness feels the brush of a shadow. Less than a morsel, unworthy of wakefulness. By some analog of distributed instinct a few listless tendrils explore this disturbance, this ripple in the darkness behind the night.

[Line 79] [Option Selected: Wait]
You wait.
Alarms are reset, battle restraints engaged. Activity on the bridge gradually quiets as all officers, crew, and systems reach a state of readiness, even anticipation - fight or flight.
The incursions crawl closer to the center of your display volume, expanding unwaveringly and intentionally. 
All eyes are on command interfaces, and all attention is on your next order.

Shrouded Substrate - analyzing / making weapons
------------------------------
[Line 82] You join your technology officer and engineering chief in a small briefing room overlooking the shop bay dedicated to what has been euphemistically dubbed "special salvage".
Haz-suited technicians attend to the containment machinery, stepping over coils of tube and wire. A mess of makeshift components were pulled from the common microforge libraries then torn apart and re-engineered to operate in this unusual, even extraordinary, application.
Engineering wears a frown, tapping a TriPad as they observe the ongoing work. Tech can barely contain their excitement. 
"$PlayerSirOrMadam," they say in unison at your arrival.

[Line 82] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrateBegin:"So. What is it?"
defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 83] [Option Selected: "So. What is it?"]
"Exotic matter!" Tech exclaims.
Engineering interrupts. "Another way of saying 'we don't know what it is', and 'it doesn't act how physics says it should'." 
Your technology officer begins again, enthusiasm tempered - somewhat. "Obviously, I was about to- $playerSirOrMadam," Tech turns to face only you, perhaps to curb further interruptions. "Analysis is preliminary and proceeding," a quick glimpse at the frowning engineering chief, "carefully."

[Line 84] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelA:"So... what is it?"]

[Line 85] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelAga2:"The Galatia Academy would be interested, I think."]

[Line 86] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelB:"Is it valuable?"]

[Line 87] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelC:"Is it useful?"]

[Line 88] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelD:"Can it be destroyed?"]

[Line 89] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelE:"Can it be weaponized?"]

[Line 90] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelF:"Show me what you can do."]

[Line 91] [Option Selected: "So... what is it?"]
Your engineering chief makes a show of looking to Tech expectantly, mouth quite intentionally shut. It appears they've had this argument already.
"As, um." Tech passes a look of consternation back toward your chief engineer.
"In truth, I could not say, exactly. And unfortunately we're not equipped to perform a full scientific investigation. Clearly it is a part of, or a product of the, the... hostile force which we bested. But to know what it IS... you'd need a full science team and laboratory facilities to even begin to approach the right questions, to say nothing of answers..."

[Line 91] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelAga:"Like the Galatia Academy."
shroudedSubstrate_optSelAtt:"Like Tri-Tachyon."]

[Line 92] [Option Selected: "Like the Galatia Academy."]
"Yes, exactly." Tech nods. "Although..."

[Line 92] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelAga2:"Although?"]

[Line 93] [Option Selected: "Although?"]
Your engineering chief answers. "Yes, there's nothing like this in the public archives. The Galatia Academy is supposed to be neutral. But as you know, $playerSirOrMadam, the Hegemony will reach in to put its hands on the controls, so to speak, if it sees something it doesn't like. The Hegemony doesn't like disruption. And this..."
A hand is extended to indicate the contents of the workbay.
Tech nods agreement, "The Ministry of Technology Standards would surely seize such specimens. I could not say what they would do with them, but we would not see them ever again. That much is certain."

[Line 93] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelAtt:"Tri-Tachyon then."]

[Line 94] [Option Selected: "Although?"]
Your engineering chief answers. "Yes, there's nothing like this in the public archives. The Galatia Academy is supposed to be neutral. But as you know, $playerSirOrMadam, the Hegemony will reach in to put its hands on the controls, so to speak, if it sees something it doesn't like. The Hegemony doesn't like disruption. And this..."
A hand is extended to indicate the contents of the workbay.
Tech nods agreement, "The Ministry of Technology Standards would surely seize such specimens. I could not say what they would do with them, but we would not see them ever again. That much is certain."

[Line 95] [Option Selected: "Tri-Tachyon then."]
Tech nods, "Yes, their facilities would be more than able to perform this research. And," a smile, "they are likely to pay very well, if what they say is true."

[Line 95] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelAttA:"What exactly do 'they' say?"
shroudedSubstrate_optSelAttB:"Who is this 'they'?"]

[Line 96] [Option Selected: "What exactly do 'they' say?"]
"The Company pays very well indeed for unique specimens," Tech explains. "Artifacts; Domain tech, xenobiology. Anything unknown to the present Persean Sector, anything strange which might demonstrate uncommon principles or serve an unexpected use."

[Line 97] [Option Selected: "Who is this 'they'?"]
"Independent salvors, scavengers, fringe surveyors," Tech explains.
"Those sorts of people who might find artifacts, specimens; Domain tech, xenobiology. Anything unknown to the present Persean Sector, anything strange which might demonstrate uncommon principles or serve unexpected use. Tri-Tachyon makes it known that great rewards will be paid if they are brought 'examples of special interest'."

[Line 98] [Option Selected: "Is it valuable?"]
"Extremely," Tech answers, exchanging a look with your chief engineer. "If the energy output ratio scales as projected..."
"It's dangerous," Engineering says. "It's almost too easy to build a weapon with this 'substrate'. Imagine if the Pathers-"
"-Yes, yes, another Mairaath," Tech interrupts. "As with any applied technology, sufficiently powerful, it could... $playerSirOrMadam. To answer your query, yes, extremely valuable."

[Line 99] [Option Selected: "Is it useful?"]
"Very," your technology officer exchanges another look with Engineering. "In my professional opinion."
"When stabilized, and... provoked, it appears to create energy from... somewhere else. Or transform it, enhance it. The gain is spectacular."
Your chief engineer steps forward. "That test with the laser-cutter would have blown a hole through the hull if," a glance at Tech, "if we were not following protocol by using a blast-plate backing in the test zone."
"Look, I did concede you were correct to-" Tech catches your expression and shuts up, putting on a deferential look.

[Line 100] [Option Selected: "Can it be destroyed?"]
Engineering smirks at Tech.
"It is essentially unstable, if left alone," Tech admits. "Without containment, it will," a pause, searching for the word. 
"Fade away? No, withdraw. Slowly. The process is non-linear, and appears to accelerate, given time. Although it's hard to measure exact terms of mass, volume, or... output. It all just becomes... less."

[Line 101] [Option Selected: "Can it be weaponized?"]
Tech looks to Engineering, who can barely suppress a grin despite a previous air of skepticism. Your chief engineer nods, and flips a TriPad around.
"It's pretty simple, $playerSirOrMadam. Scale up the testing rig using modified common equipment to produce outputs in the combat application range. A robust chassis is not difficult. We're already equipped to repair modular components of most weapon systems using microforged components and existing supply stocks." 
They pause, looking into the workbay once more. "The key is this 'substrate'. It provides the core, the... amplification, the transformation."

[Line 101] [Options Given: shroudedSubstrate_optSelE2:Continue]

[Line 102] [Option Selected: Continue]
Tech speaks up, "Using sensor data recorded during our encounter with the, um, hostile entities, we believe it is possible to reliably reproduce certain effects which have been observed."
The schematics scrolling before you are complex, but you recognize the conduits and capacitors common to energy weapon mounts. And something strange at the center of each design, some beating heart which does not belong within these human creations.
You trust your officers enough not to ask if the projected power outputs are an error - you've already seen what these things are capable of.

[Line 103] [Option Selected: "Show me what you can do."]
"$PlayerSirOrMadam," they say once more in unison.

Engineering is frowning, manipulating a diagram of a ship with abrupt flicks at the interface. "It'd have to be anchored to the flux grid. Only way to keep it wrapped close enough to the hull geometry."
"Precisely," Tech says. "To keep the exotic material from diminishing! It will draw energy from incoming projectiles, storing it in the, um... meta-plasma?"
Engineering snorts dismissively.
"Merely a working term," Tech says defensively.

[Line 115] [Options Given: ShroudedHMM_talk3:Continue]

[Line 116] [Option Selected: Continue]
"We can't store energy forever in this theoretical, pretend-plasma," Engineering says. "It'll have to go somewhere."
"Invert the polarity of the flux converters and flicker the drive field. Boom, a gentle bump to local time-space." Tech looks self-satisfied. "Um, by which I mean the ship itself."
"You hope it's a gentle bump." Engineering frowns, pulling up agrav inertial suppression timing charts. "If it works."

[Line 117] Option(s) Selected: ['ShroudedHMM_talk3']
"It'll work," Tech says.

Tech is spinning a dazzlingly complex holo-mockup filled with arcing lines and arcane symbols. 
"A cloud of the exotic material could be held within a sort of flickered hyperspace gradient... Theoretically, it would build up charge as outgoing projectiles traverse the 'imbued' field gradient and... theoretically, that extra charge could be sustained then directed at nearby hostiles."

[Line 126] [Options Given: ShroudedHMTH_talk3:Continue]

[Line 127] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Theoretically." Engineering's arms are crossed below a very skeptical look.
"To operate during combat... hmm. Modifications would have to be made. Shield emitters, drive field, inertial suppression... I'll need to perform some tests."
Engineering finally notices you observing their talk and stands to attention. "With your approval, $PlayerSirOrMadam."

"This 'lens' - a working term, of course - does not operate in normal space as-such."
Tech is deep in lecture mode over an arcane holo-diagram. You can tell they've been talking for some minutes from Engineering's impatient eye roll.
"It could be emplaced deep within the hull, in a specially stabilized cradle - for safety," Tech continues.
Engineering appears pained at describing this proposal as 'safe'.

[Line 132] [Options Given: ShroudedHML_talk3:Continue]

[Line 133] [Option Selected: Continue]
Tech proceeds without acknowledging any objection.
"-spin it up during combat maneuvers, adjusting the frequency of the 'probes' adapted from drive-field stabilizers. It would create hyperspace fractures which would cause terrible damage to n-space structures. Starships, for instance. Now, for obvious reasons, the theoretical range is infinite..."

[Line 133] [Options Given: ShroudedHML_talk4:"A weapon with infinite range, you say?"]

[Line 134] [Option Selected: "A weapon with infinite range, you say?"]
Both jump at your words, standing to attention. "$PlayerSirOrMadam!" they say in uncharacteristic unison.
Engineering takes the opportunity to finally get a word in. "Accuracy decreases in... interestingly, a sharp harmonic progression. But this means anything beyond mid-range combat parameters will effectively create an energetic burst at a random spot somewhere within the n-space universe." They side-eye Tech. "Just another blip of cosmic background radiation."
Tech looks like they might say something, but no words come. Engineering fills the silence again. "Practically, it could only target reasonably nearby hostiles."

The huge planet spins languidly below your $shipOrFleet, deep in a cryosleep of its own between the far-flung stars of the galaxy. Gravitational compression and the barest trickle of radioactive decay warm the interior well above the interstellar medium, feeding active weather systems which slowly churn across the cold face of the world.
"$PlayerSirOrMadam, I-" your sensors officer pulls up the live feed from a sensor subsuite. This gets the attention of Tactical.
After a moment, even you can see it: a disruption, a gout of sudden turbulence like a dozen giant hurricanes turning over.

"Massive storm system. Sudden heat anomaly, um, relatively speaking. Some kind of upwelling," your sensors officer responds, rapid-fire. You know they don't like not having a clear answer.
"Powering up gravimetrics. If there's something hiding under those clouds, that'll show it."
They tap at their console, calibrating a new subsuite of the $shipOrFleet sensor network. The minutes tick by as the systems self-adjust to the planet, the estimated accuracy of readings steadily rising on the shared display. The readout sharpens, clarifies, begins to map the mass-density of $entityName.
At the same time, the anomaly subsides, leaving storm-cells the size of moons spinning through the atmosphere.

Sensors looks increasingly agitated, rapidly switching between sensor interfaces to collate telemetry.
"Captain, I cannot ascertain the cause. A huge burst of energy was released into the atmosphere, an upwelling like... the mass readings don't show any unexpected structures or objects, natural or otherwise."
Tactical frowns, ever suspicious, and says "This happens just when our $shipOrFleet arrives? I don't like it."

Below, $entityName spins complacently, its shadow-side occasionally lit with patches of lightning as titanic atmospheric currents do battle.

[Line 141] Your $shipOrFleet approaches $entityName.
Upon your return, your sensors officer is determined not to be caught off-guard again. The sensor net is set to high intensity and the gravimetric suite is loaded with the previously collected calibration data.
There's no sign of unusual turbulence; just the crawl of atmospheric bands, lightning storms flickering where their edges meet like battling fleets in a far-off nebula.

Rogue planetoid in abyssal space; cleaned up mining OP
------------------------------
[Line 144] Your $shipOrFleet approaches $entityName.
A preliminary surface scan reveals certain inconsistencies in expected mass-densities for this category of planetoid.
Your sensors officer orders additional sweeps, at higher power and resolution. A picture of the situation starts to come together: large deposits of useful elements have been extracted and the dig-sites, whether surface deposits or deep veins, have been carefully returned to something approximating their natural state. Shafts have been infilled, tailings spread evenly and packed over the extraction fields.
Sensors consults with your operations chief, who did a stint in fringe mining earlier in their career. Ops looks grim.

"Don't look right, $playerSirOrMadam," Ops says, turning a weathered face to you.
"Aye, could've been an indie miner or scav. Could've. But there's nothing- no temporary works, no pillaring, no tread tracks. Should be dead power cells and ration wrappers scattered like stars in the dark. Ain't nothing."
Ops scowls. "No one cleans up like this, not even Tachy autominers. No profit in it. Especially not out here."

[Line 146] Your $shipOrFleet approaches $entityName.
The faint signs of a massive mining operation remain and are just as suspiciously neat as before, as tidy as a penitent Luddic rock-gardener. Sensor records do not show any significant changes since the last scan.

The outside hull is oddly pristine, as if sent on a long journey fresh from the forge without personalized outfitting and customization.
Your salvors breach the exterior and find a different story: crudely anchored power conduits and coolant tubes have been rigged haphazardly through the shafts and corridors of the ship. Safety doors are stuck open and hatches cut through to provide access to serpentine bundles of cable. It's not high-quality work; the occasional powered-down maintenance drone, stupid automatic things meant to assist human technicians, suggests the obvious culprits.
Your salvors must make numerous cuts to clear access to core ship systems. It is not dangerous, merely inconvenient. It is near the true centerpoint of the hull volume that they find a trio of AI cores, two gammas and a beta from the looks of the casings. They are unpowered, the coolant congealed in its pipes.

The last survivor, suited against the apparent life support failure, is found near the jury-rigged power generator that was spliced into the ship's shield-grid. The suit's safeties were overridden and its atmo mix of oxygen reduced to zero.

It is not a tomb-ship, however. 
By numbers, most of the crew appears to have escaped before leaving the hull derelict. A few unfortunate victims of personal violence - or parts of them - appear to have been left behind from some kind of internal conflict.

A cursory trawl of what logs the senior officers bothered to keep suggests that this ship was part of a small pirate flotilla tracking a well-supplied independent expedition working its way through the outer fringe. That expedition spotted the pirates, then burned rapidly toward the Abyss. The pirates followed and soon lost their prey in the stultifying darkness.
With supplies and fuel dwindling and no certainty of a 'hostile resupply', the pirate leadership began to argue, and then to scrap hulls while consolidating crew onto the remaining ships - at the barrel of a gun, as necessary.
There wasn't quite enough room for everyone, it appears.

Descending to Asher, you glance out the viewport of your shuttle.
Stars disappear from the black tapestry of space as it begins to glow with a deep violet-blue before sinking into dim, ruddy brown.
The thick clouds of suspended fines are whipped away by the shuttle's flight through cold winds, and the shadow is replaced by the generalized sandy murk of Asher.

"Doesn't look like much, does it," says Senior Engineer Tanaica as she takes the sample from you - a block of armor composite, edges rough from the salvors' plasma cutters.
She places the sample onto a shelf which retracts into the towering white casing of the analysis suite. Transparent panes reveal the machine's arcane inner workings.
"You found it in the Abyss, you said?"
A containment shield drops over the sample port with a satisfying clunk.

She manipulates the controls, evacuating the atmo from the sample container. Then she stops to look at you.
"If this is just a chunk of starship armor, I can tell you that for free. Saves you 10,000 credits."
"But if you want me to look real close and do some professional speculation," she holds out her datapad, ready to receive payment.

[Line 235] [Option Selected: Pay 10,000 credits]
Your TriPad pings confirmation, and hers responds cheerfully.
"Right then," she says, equally cheerful.
Tanaica's datapad disappears as she turns back to the controls. A loud humming grows - it feels almost ticklish in your teeth for a moment as she adjusts power levels.
Displays bloom with readouts, cheerful greens abounding. A holo of the sample flickers into being.

[Line 237] [Option Selected: "What's weird?"]
Tanaica manipulates her controls and a small cutaway pulls out of the rough block of armor. It scales to fill the volume of the holo.
Another segmentation of scale iterates, then another as Tanaica brings the resolution to the nearly-atomic. Patterns of false colour flash highlighting pseudo-crystals, various regular - and irregular - structures, as well as flaws.
"It's the damnedest thing, isn't it," she says, attention focused on the display.

"It's nanoforged. Obvious stuff, look at that drift," she taps something and a distortion in the material structure becomes exaggerated.
"Crude, relatively speaking. Modern forges won't do it like this. Hm. 'Modern' meaning anything from the last thousand cycles. Seems like you found a genuine museum piece. Not unheard of 'course. Scavengers pull in bits of old sporeships and Explorarium junk often enough. Saw a bit of cryosleeper scanned when I was in training. Fascinating stuff."
She taps not the controls, but the casing of the analysis suite. "So it's old, but that's not what's strange."

"Haven't seen this before." She rubs her fingers together, thinking. "Either someone was running a starsystem polity-level illicit forge a couple thousand cycles ago and you found the results, or... hm, you found something really weird."
She turns to you. "Where'd you find this? Some rock in the Abyss?"

[Line 243] [Options Given: oyaTanaica_vambrace8:"Some rock. Why can't it have been legally forged with no FRM?"]

[Line 244] [Option Selected: "Some rock. Why can't it have been legally forged with no FRM?"]
"That's... that'd be insane. The whole point of the Domain was to control this stuff! Well," she concedes to herself, "Maybe the Gate Network was point number one."
"But regulating the nanoforges would have been two. Maybe three. Definitely important. Everything is stamped and tracked, that way you know who made what, where it ends up, when to collect forge-taxes, and who to blame when things go wrong."
"It was..." She shakes her hands at the analysis suite in an odd gesture, emphasizing the size of the concept. "It was the basis for interstellar civilization itself!"

She takes a deep breath, looking self-conscious at her own outburst, then busies herself with flicking at some controls; the machine slows its hum to a dull whine and then a sudden unsettling absence of a background noise you weren't even conscious of hearing.
"Some rebel polity in the Domain-era I guess? Maybe they had some frontier-freedom notions before the Domain Armada re-stomped them into compliance. I'd pay good credits myself to learn how in Ludd's seven hells it ended up on some rock in the Abyss!"
She catches herself, then grins. "Uh, not that I wouldn't appreciate that answer for free if you happen to solve it."

Stranded in deep space with no Transverse Jump
------------------------------
[Line 258] It can't be denied any longer.
You're stuck in deep space near an obscure celestial object having foolishly jumped in before ensuring your $shipOrFleet could jump back out.
The bridge officers are very carefully avoiding an outright panic, assigning makework maintenance duties and shutting down speculation. Still, you can't help but notice questioning glances - spacers will follow almost any order, but this is a serious blunder. 
Your navigation officer appears to be having a heated intra-ship comms discussion with your engineering chief. You catch key phrases, "too dangerous", "theoretically impossible", "worked once".

[Line 258] [Options Given: strandedInDeepSpace0:"Nav, report."]

[Line 259] [Option Selected: "Nav, report."]
Navigation, deeply embarrassed to be caught mid-argument, salutes and explains.
It appears that a senior technician on hyperdrive duty is insisting on speaking with you. They have some kind of crazy idea about getting back into hyperspace and have somehow convinced your chief engineer that it's viable.

[Line 259] [Options Given: strandedInDeepSpace1:"Meeting, now. My cabin."]

[Line 260] [Option Selected: "Meeting, now. My cabin."]
Ancient and rad-scarred, the senior technician is senior indeed, likely having more space experience than any other crew or officer in your service. The old spacer produces a minimum viable salute. "$PlayerSirOrMadam. All respect, but you've done a real dirt-boot screw-up putting the $shipOrFleet out in a nothing-nowhere gravwell."
Your navigation officer inhales to begin a reprimand, but the spacer burns ahead, "Good news is I've seen it possible to jump direct to hyperspace. Risky, though," they say, looking down. "Risky."
"But," a crooked smile appears, "Better'n having to eat the officers, aye?"

[Line 260] [Options Given: strandedInDeepSpace2:"What is your proposal, senior technician?"]

[Line 261] [Option Selected: "What is your proposal, senior technician?"]
The legendary smuggler captain who showed this trick to the senior tech made them promise never to tell a soul about it. But seeing as how she died some forty cycles previously, and given the current situation, the old spacer is willing to bend the spirit of the agreement slightly to get out of this mess.
A modification to the hyperdrive field software will allow you to perform a kind of Transverse Jump directly to hyperspace from normal space. It's also useful for jumping through sub-viable jump-points which are inaccessible when making hyperjumps within Domain-approved parameters. 
Nav looks aghast and Engineering is shaking their head as they review the proposed modifications on a beaten-up TriPad.

[Line 261] [Options Given: strandedInDeepSpace3a:"Will it work?"
strandedInDeepSpace3b:"What are the risks?"
strandedInDeepSpace3c:"Make the modifications and prepare to jump."]

[Line 262] [Option Selected: "Will it work?"]
Your navigation officer sighs, looking distraught.
"Theoretically," they say, rubbing their eyes.
"It's extremely unorthodox. This... this inverted resonance stacking notion," they poke at an arcane diagram which rotates along axes somewhat north of four dimensions, arcs and lines jittering with non-euclidean enthusiasm through the mere three-dimensional space of the holo.
"It shouldn't work. The math appears to give the correct solution, but to get there..."

[Line 263] [Option Selected: "What are the risks?"]
Your chief engineer stops shaking their head to answer.
"Well. Our field generators weren't designed for this, but it should fall - just - within failure limits. We'll have to go to combat agrav, stow everything and everyone."
A sigh, as if giving up, then, "If it doesn't work, we're all dead and it'll be so quick we won't even know it. If it works, it's going to hurt. Expect a significant hit to operational readiness. And we'll need repairs."
A thoughtful look, "Of course, assuming it works, with the telemetry to calibrate from..."
Your navigation officer looks stricken at the thought.

[Line 264] [Option Selected: "Make the modifications and prepare to jump."]
"$PlayerSirOrMadam," they all respond. The old spacer grins unevenly once more to your senior officers' frowns.

wormhole cache

[Line 268] With the automated defenses cleared, your salvors are free to crack open the enormous zero-G vaults of the cache. Power is provided to dead conduits, fused circuits replaced with temporary fittings, and the great doors persuaded to loosen their mechanical restraints.
At first, it appears to be empty. A colossal tomb, never filled. Then probe-mounted radar starts to build a picture in your bridge display while suit lights pile their beams into the space, catching drifts of dust and gas set afloat by the re-opening. Spars gleam in the dark, revealing trifold radial symmetry.
"$PlayerSirOrMadam," your tech officer says, attention fixed not on the suit cams or bridge display but on technical specs scrolling through a display already overfull with diagrams and documents. "You have to see this."

Ice giant which the Gate Hauler orbits

[Line 273] Your $shipOrFleet approaches $entityName.
The ice giant spins below your $shipOrFleet, lit only by the barest light of the galaxy, warmed only by the internal pressure of gravity and the barest flicker of atomic decay. Unlikely to form naturally in interstellar space, this planet must have been thrown from its home system by some cataclysmic interaction in aeons past. Adrift, it is doomed to shrink and cool toward the interstellar medium over billions of cycles.

Gate Hauler interactions

[Line 276] Your $shipOrFleet approaches the $entityName.
It is a Leviathan from out of time, at once familiar from its many and varied depictions in the secondary culture of the post-Collapse Persean Sector.
But to see it here in the proverbial flesh, it is the alien force of the Domain's power reified before you, looming like a blackened emperor slumped dead - but dreaming still - on a throne of stars.
You feel the weight of history pressing upon your chest, a tone like a distant ringing. You are frozen for an unconscious moment as if your mind was held in the gaze of a god; and in the next instant it is nothing but the buzz of power conduits and low thrum of agrav within the drive bubble, usually relegated to a filter of unperception by your subconscious.
You adjust your uniform and turn to your bridge officers.

Before you is a Leviathan from out of time, at once familiar from its many and varied depictions in the secondary culture of the post-Domain Persean Sector. You can feel the magisterial force upon you; your officers and crew are hushed, humbled and reverent, as if they have found themselves before the corpse of a thunderous and cruel god who once ruled the skies. To awaken it, to touch the divine, must fall somewhere between sacrilege and sanctification.

[Line 278] [Option Selected: Order salvage teams to perform an assessment]
It is no simple task to appraise a Gate Hauler, for the ship is truly massive.
Your officers, however, have the tools, ancient datafiles, and a trained and ready crew. Known variants of Gate Hauler design are pulled up on a shared display to match to the example which looms over your $shipOrFleet. Your operations chief oversees the deployment of salvors to key points in coordination with targeted sensor sweeps.
Meanwhile, your tech officer and chief engineer review the deep archive containing flight statistics on thousands of recorded Gate Hauler deployments in order to anticipate the results of in-transit damage and subsequent self-repair protocols.

[Line 278] [Options Given: gh_explore2:"Tell me what happened here."]

[Line 279] [Option Selected: "Tell me what happened here."]
Ops orders the salvors to prioritize a data connection, and it's soon online via ancient protocols. Walls of amber error codes glow in your tech officer's interface. 
You have part of an answer soon enough: The functioning of the Gate Hauler's enormous but primitive Alcubierre drive system was massively disrupted mid-transit. The ship's automation could not ascertain the cause of the discontinuity and so, to protect the literally astronomical value of its cargo, forced the ship into an automatic failsafe mode.
Most of the remaining fuel was dumped and the rest used to slow into an orbit of the most accessible nearby mass concentration: this lonely ice giant. The maneuver took the better part of a century.
Standard procedure would have the Domain send a well-supplied expedition of Gate engineers to reset the primary systems and send the Hauler back on its journey, albeit many hundreds of cycles behind schedule.

[Line 279] [Options Given: gh_explore3:"But no one showed up."]

[Line 280] [Option Selected: "But no one showed up."]
The ancient records note that Gate Haulers would carry a standard complement of automated survey, extraction, and refining drones in the case of lost-contact. The documents seem to imply the ability to procure new sources of fuel and materials effectively at vast distances from the fail-safe point, though at the scale implied, this process would be inefficient at superluminal speeds even via hyperspace - assuming use of baseline Domain frontier technology.
Your officers conclude that, typical to the Domain, the publically available descriptions seem to elide certain key technologies and capabilities.
In any event, your survey turned up none of this - aside from the undeployed Gate itself, of course, held tight by the many-limbed face of the great starship.

You can only conclude that this particular self-recovery effort ended with the drone expedition sent to the Limbo system, and it was to use obscure Explorarium wormhole technology to resupply the Gate Hauler so that it could continue its mission. 
In any event, your search has turned up no additional technological treasures - aside from the undeployed Gate itself, of course, held tight in the many-limbed face of the great starship.

The details accumulate, each senior officer manipulating the shared display as reports are given. Finally, your chief engineer clears the holo back to a slowly rotating false-lit overview of the entire vast starship. They suppress a brief smile as they clear their throat.
"$PlayerSirOrMadam." A pause for anticipation, a rare indulgence by your habitually practical chief engineer. "I have the pleasure to report that it is possible to re-activate the Gate Hauler. It could be targeted to a known system within the Persean Sector at your command."
It just needs transplutonics. A lot of transplutonics. Unlike familiar starship engines, the Gate Hauler doesn't use the standard Domain AM fuel package. Once a critical mass of transplutonics is achieved, the Gate Hauler will be able to operate for at least a thousand cycles with functionally unlimited range within the bounds of the Persean Sector.

Your tech officer taps at a datapad with a vexed look, but raises no objection.
A silence descends. There is no need to put it into words: the arrival of a Gate Hauler in the Persean Sector would be momentous.

[Line 284] [Option Selected: "Tell me how to turn this thing back on. I want numbers, chief."]

Your operations chief oversees the transfer of transplutonics. Streams of cargo drones feed the unimaginably huge bulk of the Hauler; it seems strange that so little can move so much so far.
With only a little coaxing, the Gate Hauler's automation churns into something like machine-awareness; sensors reports power surges throughout the hull as ancient conduits and machines self-test - some failing. Long-dormant self-repair drones begin to seethe like vermin.
And, slowly, your $shipOrFleet's various sensors feel the growing power of the machine. Magnetic fields shudder, neutrinos begin to spill forth in earnest from reactions deep in the mass of the beast; gravitic fluctuations from the warp-pylons flutter, and your own drive bubble compensates.
It will take about a day, engineering reports, and then the Gate Hauler will be ready to receive navigational input.

Once provided with a destination, the Gate Hauler will travel through normal space - a Gate cannot be moved through hyperspace. The Hauler will travel faster than lightspeed, thankfully, due to its venerable Alcubierre drive. Indeed, the Hauler will quickly accelerate to an apparent normal-space speed which your $shipOrFleet cannot match with its relatively tiny in-system drives. The journey will still take quite some time, due to travelling significantly slower than standard hyperspace permits.
After it has arrived at the target destination, you may give the order to deploy the Gate to an unoccupied stable location.

The Gate Hauler rests in space, a potent mass jealously cradling its legendary cargo. It awaits final confirmation to deploy the Gate.
As it happens, the go-code requests telemetry from the Gate Hauler's launch as a pass-key. After several tense seconds, the re-launch telemetry appears to be accepted as valid input, and executive access is granted to your command console.  
Functionality is limited: Gate deployment can only be targeted broadly at a star system or roughly equivalent celestial structure. The Hauler's programming allows for no fine control and will select its own stable location. The process is irreversible and the order can not be countermanded once given. After deployment, the Gate Hauler will automatically dismantle itself, presumably to become feedstock for the next glorious expansion of the Domain's frontier.

relationship level descriptions
------------------------------
[Line 653] You are trusted and valued by $theFaction, green-lit by patrols and port authorities alike, and have considerable access to high-level officials. You are given much leeway, and may receive trade concessions and access to high-quality ships and munitions.

[Line 654] You're relatively well-known within $theFaction, whether in person or by reputation. Minor functionaries know to stay out of your way.

[Line 655] Your name is known to some high-level officials in $theFaction. Harassing you is therefore a more risky endeavor for local patrol commanders.

[Line 656] The $faction officials tend to view you favorably, though this has little in the way of implications. At best, you might be sold some low-grade surplus military equipment, or avoid being the target of an investigation if a more convenient scapegoat is available.

[Line 657] You're not generally well known by $faction officials, for good or ill.

[Line 658] Though nothing has been proven (yet), $faction officials tend to view you with distrust. Link access to the port authority is granted only grudgingly, and you find yourself the subject of investigations and harassment frequently.

[Line 659] Suspicions have risen to an actionable level. There's no shoot-on-sight authorization quite yet, but $faction ports will refuse to trade with you, and patrols seem on a mission to make your life miserable.

[Line 660] $Faction commanders have authorization to engage your fleet on sight, and all markets are prohibited from trading with you. You might still recover good standing with $theFaction, but it's going to take some serious work.

[Line 661] A holo of your face and an IDENT-hash of your last known fleet are both regular parts of inter-system security bulletins. It's fairly certain there's a high-ranking $faction officer whose primary assignment is to hunt you down.

[Line 662] Independent fleet operators and leading officials of non-aligned polities consider you a friend and valuable asset. You are favored in business and contracts, given priority docking access, and invited to dine with VIPs. You are given great leeway due to the goodwill you have earned.

[Line 663] You have a good reputation with more than a few high-level independent fleet commanders and non-aligned polity officials in the Persean Sector. You are considered a good operator, favored in matters of business and easily forgiven minor indiscretions.

[Line 664] Your name is known by many independent commanders and non-aligned polity officials. You are considered a safe operator, made welcome in matters of business and easily forgiven for minor indiscretions.

[Line 665] You are considered a reliable operator by the independent fleet operations and minor polities of the Persean Sector. You are welcome in matters of business.

[Line 666] Your reputation is not considered notable by the independent fleet operations and minor polities of the Persean Sector. If you're willing to do business, then you will be welcomed.

[Line 667] Though nothing has been proven (yet), $faction officials tend to view you with distrust. Link access to the port authority is granted only grudgingly, and you find yourself the subject of investigations and harassment frequently.

[Line 668] Suspicions have risen to an actionable level. There's no shoot-on-sight authorization quite yet, but $faction ports will refuse to trade with you, and patrols seem on a mission to make your life miserable.

[Line 669] Opportunistic independent captains may engage your fleet on sight to collect the open bounty that has been pooled to ensure your downfall. Unaligned markets are closed to you, as you are considered worse even than most pirates. You might still recover your standing with the non-aligned polities of the Sector, but it's going to take some serious work.

[Line 670] You are a scourge of the spaceways. A holo of your face and scan of your $shipOrFleet are traded between independent flotillas and administrators as part of an unofficial collective security arrangement. It is likely that a well-paid mercenary company is working to hunt you down.

[Line 671] You are known to have performed work for Provost Baird of the Galatia Academy.

[Line 672] Your exploits are legendary and inspire scores of imitators. Your underworld connections and influence are enviable, giving access to black markets and hired guns; a river of hot goods, drugs, and armaments are available at your whim.

[Line 673] You've proven useful to some of the leaders of the various criminal enterprises in the Sector. Harassing you may be more trouble than it's worth to a pirate who wants to breathe something more substantial than vacuum.

[Line 674] Pirates respect your swagger, and are inclined to respect the notoriety you've gained in the underworld that allows you to throw your weight around a little to get what you want.

[Line 675] You've been around pirates, smugglers, and other criminals often enough, and know how to act so they treat you as one of their own. The benefits of this comradeliness are dubious at best, of course, because they're known to gun one another down if enough credits are on the line.

[Line 676] You've been around pirates, smugglers, and criminals long enough to know how to conduct business with them. That doesn't mean they won't attack if the opportunity presents itself, of course.

[Line 677] Pirates are generally only suspicious towards you, which is a far sight better than the loathing they hold for most 'legitimate' space-captains. This doesn't mean they won't attack you if the credits are good, of course. Pirates are pirates, after all. 

[Line 678] Pirates will keep their weapons warm around your $shipOrFleet, and view you with distrust. This is more than can be said for how they view their fellows much of the time, so it's not as if hostility is insurmountable if a large number of credits or sufficient intimidation is in play.

[Line 679] Although you are not utterly despised, pirates are more than willing to attack if they believe you have credits or cargo to plunder.
Or if they're bored.

[Line 680] Many pirates fear you, but few respect anything but your powerful fleet. Pirate bases are not willing to trade openly with you to avoid being seen as 'collaborators'. Pirates will attack you if they catch you in a moment of weakness. 

[Line 681] You are scorned as mere prey and despised as a lackey serving the fat, rich factions of the Persean Sector.

[Line 682] You are hated by Pirates; they use a holo of your face for target-practice. No doubt there is a brash young pirate assembling a kill-fleet to ambush you to secure the immortality of their name, if not person, in the lawless shadows of the Persean Sector.

[Line 683] You have paid off Warlord Kanta to ensure that pirates - mostly - don't attack your colonies.

[Line 684] You had, and lost, Warlord Kanta's protection over your holdings.

[Line 685] You are the one who spaced Kanta's clone of Loke.

[Line 686] You are considered an exemplar of the Andradan Ideal. Patrol officers know that their careers, and perhaps lives, depend on making your life as pleasant as possible. A rather grand holo-version of you is featured in propaganda segments extolling your embodiment of the values the Supreme Executor forges in the worthy.

[Line 687] You've been flagged for official treatment as a trusted supporter of the Andradan Movement, a friend and ally of Sindrian Diktat authority. Minor functionaries know that their careers and possibly lives depend on easing your business with Diktat-controlled volumes.

[Line 688] Your name is spoken well of among some of the high-level officials in the various ministries of the Sindrian Diktat, and it is clear that there is some kind of official note attached to your record. Local patrol commanders and port authority officers alike know what's good for their careers and make a point of treating you politely and efficiently.

[Line 689] You have been flagged as a known quantity in the records kept by the Sindrian Diktat security apparatus. Officials tend to view you favorably, though don't go out of their way to make life easy. At best, you might be sold some low-grade surplus military equipment, or avoid being the target of an investigation if a more convenient scapegoat is available.

[Line 690] You're not generally well known by the Sindrian Diktat security apparatus. If you keep your head down and your mouth shut, you'll probably be fine unless some Lion's Guard officer wants to make an example out of someone.

[Line 691] Though you have not been declared a state enemy, it is clear that you have been flagged by the Sindrian Diktat security apparatus. Port officials view you with distrust, fulfilling procedural requests slowly and singling you out for unnecessary inspections and checks.

[Line 692] The Sindrian Diktat security apparatus has flagged you as a suspected terrorist, though has not yet issued a shoot-on-sight order. Diktat-controlled ports will refuse to trade with you, and patrols seem to make it their mission to make your life miserable.

[Line 693] You have joined the ranks of those declared enemies of the state. The Sindrian Diktat navy has authorization to engage your fleet, and traders are prohibited from dealing with you for fear of being declared supporters of terrorism.

[Line 694] You have been declared a state enemy by the Sindrian Diktat and seen as a deranged terrorist against the Andradan Movement. Uncharitably modified holos of you performing crimes and sordid acts have appeared in official propaganda broadcasts.

[Line 695] There are rumors that you're a double or triple-agent working for - or against? - Dolos Macario.

[Line 696] The board of directors considers you an exemplar of the corporation's core values as well as a key strategic partner. VPs use management methods based on the growth-focused synergies you inspire. Vast investment capital and technical expertise are made available through your Tri-Tachyon connections.

[Line 697] A smiling holo of you appears in the Tri-Tachyon quarterly corporate report as an example of a key partner in various enterprises. You are given special perks and priority access to facilities owned or operated by Tri-Tachyon and its subsidiaries.

[Line 698] The Tri-Tachyon Customer and Client Service Smart Database assigns you priority docking and a complimentary fruit and flower arrangement at every port controlled by Tri-Tachyon or one of its subsidiaries. Even if this is automated by a technically non-sentient sub-AI system, it is a sign that the Tri-Tachyon corporation values your ongoing business relationship.

[Line 699] Due to your status as a valued partner, the standard oxygen and agrav convenience fee has been waived for your visits to Tri-Tachyon or subsidiary owned facilities.

[Line 700] The Tri-Tachyon Customer and Client Service Smart Database, a Domain certified equivalent sub-gamma AI system dedicated to tracking potential competition, has not tagged your profile for special treatment or caution.

[Line 701] Your profile with the Tri-Tachyon Customer and Client Service Smart Database has been algorithmically tagged as "potential risk" resulting in additional small "security fees" and delays when docking at facilities owned or operated by Tri-Tachyon or its subsidiaries.

[Line 702] A Tri-Tachyon sub-AI (alleged) tracks your movements through the Sector, and when docked at a wholly owned or subsidiary facility, you are followed by an indiscreet security drone. Employees of the corporation treat you with suspicion, performing additional checks to avoid risk to their quarterly bonus.  

[Line 703] Employees of Tri-Tachyon have been given the opportunity to earn a substantial increase to their quarterly performance bonus if they manage to kill you or, failing that, destroy your ability to cause further harm to the interests of the Company. A truly astronomical bribe might get you back in their good books.

[Line 704] Tri-Tachyon has assigned an AI core to theorycrafting your destruction and set aside a mercenary fund to see it done. Your name has its own byline, in red, in quarterly corporate reports and a rather uglier version of you features in procedurally-generated children's adutainment holos.

[Line 705] A special department has taken an interest in how you have found so many AI cores.

[Line 706] Truly, you walk upon the Path. It is not a Path of peace, and it marches ceaselessly toward the end-time, which is soon. Your fellow Walkers will keep Faith with you, whether into the blessed martyrdom of battle or into the great unknown that is God's plan, revealed only to the prophets such as Ludd and, some say, Brother Cotton.

[Line 707] You are a fellow Walker on the Path. Your name is passed between secret Watchers who hold the Faith secretly in every port, every fleet, and maintain a network of information built on human trust and heart. These Watchers would aid you in unexpected ways at unexpected times.

[Line 708] Your name is spoken of well among the secret cells and far-flung sects that make up the Luddic Path. Those few worlds controlled by Path-aligned polities welcome your trade, and will do their best to ensure that some excitable fanatic doesn't try to attack you.

[Line 709] Your name is spoken occasionally in the secret networks of the Luddic Path, and it is spoken of with tentative trust and praise. Still, the Path is a loose association and some fanatic might still get the wrong idea and try to extort a tithe from you, or worse.

[Line 710] You are not considered a great evil by the Luddic Path, though that won't stop them from demanding "tithes" or destroying your "sinful technology" if a fanatical group of militants becomes inspired to take worldly action.

[Line 711] You are known among some Luddic Path as one who may be open to the wisdom of Ludd's true teachings. Or you may not, for you are still of the Tribe of Moloch, and it is known that Ludd would not frown upon your destruction.

[Line 712] The Watchers of the Path are everywhere, and they whisper that you might not be so lost a soul as once you appeared. Nonetheless, excitable Pather fleetmasters may still attempt to extract tithes from you using threat of destruction in the Holy Vacuum.

[Line 713] To the Luddic Path you are considered a minion of Moloch and slave to demonic technology. You are a witless ally of Mammon, striving in this sin-filled world not for love of God but for only the hedonic lucre of miserable unbelievers blind to Ludd's Revelation.

[Line 714] Pather-aligned priests rail against you in their sermons; they call you a wrathful AI-conjured homunculus. Your destruction is a holy duty. It's only a matter of time before some fanatic takes a shot at you in a bar, or a Pather fleetmaster jumps at the opportunity for martyrdom.

[Line 715] Causing you harm has been declared proscribed by the Luddic Path due to an act of great service to their cause.

[Line 716] Causing you harm has been declared proscribed by the Luddic Path due to an act of great service to their cause. You are also known to have traded words with Brother Cotton.

[Line 717] It is known that you traded words with Brother Cotton - and lived.

[Line 718] Truly, you walk with Ludd. Even the most pious curates concede that your worldly actions have bolstered the Faith, and they pray for your wellbeing. The Knights of Ludd put great trust in your handling of technology for righteous cause. Even heretical sects admire your conduct, despite their departures from Church canon.

[Line 719] The Luddic Faithful of the Church count you as a friend, made welcome in their lands and trusted in dealings. You are allowed to self-moderate unsubtle use of technologies without need for the heavy hand of the Knights of Ludd to guide you toward righteousness.

[Line 720] The Church welcomes you to the volumes they control, and their Knights of Ludd watch you with less suspicion than most spacers. You know to make the expected signs of respect, and modestly hide those technologies which cause offense to the most conservative Faithful.

[Line 721] You are greeted by the Faithful with a warmth of neighborliness, nothing more. You know the words and the signs that offer respect to the Church of Galactical Redemption, and for that many, but not all, of them return that respect. 

[Line 722] You know enough about the beliefs and practices of the Luddic Church to avoid obvious gaffes, and they know how to deal with outsiders well enough to politely conduct business with you.

[Line 723] You are seen as a typical spacer; dismissive of Ludd's revelation and scornful of the Church. Your use of high technology is considered reckless, filling a hollow in your soul with false comforts of the material world. Some among the Faithful pity you, others distrust you.

[Line 724] Curates of the Church of Galactic Redemption offer you as example of one led far astray from Ludd's revelation; one lost in the machine; perhaps not yet lost to Moloch, but an unwitting servant to evil. The Knights look wary upon you, and subject you to unnecessary delays and investigation.

[Line 725] The Church considers you a minion of Moloch, a slave to demonic technology. You are a witless ally of Mammon, striving only for the hedonic lucre of miserable unbelievers blind to Ludd's Revelation. Yea, you are an agent of evil and must be treated with as such.

[Line 726] The Luddic Church portrays you as a wrathful corruptor, sinful and unrepentant, a desecrator of that which is holy and good. The Knights of Ludd have assigned an Inquisitor to your case; even some curates have suggested that it might not be a sin to kill you. It's only a matter of time before some fanatic makes an attempt.

[Line 727] You are known to have pilgrimaged to, or at least visited, the shrines of the Pilgrim's Path.

[Line 728] You are upheld as a friend, ally, and patriot of the League (and the gens); an example held high for those building a new, free system of federated polities among the stars to counter those who would recast the chains of Domain hegemony.

[Line 729] You are given friendly welcome by agents of the Persean League, including fleet, customs, and intelligence services. The great gens of Kazeron favor you in matters of business and easily forgive minor indiscretions.

[Line 730] Your name is known and welcomed among the worlds of the Persean League - and the gens of Kazeron - including the shared Fleet. You are considered a safe operator, made welcome in matters of business and easily forgiven for minor indiscretions.

[Line 731] You are considered a reliable operator among the worlds of the Persean League and by their shared navy. The gens of Kazeron even welcome you in matters of business, though you are still considered an outsider.

[Line 732] Officials of the Persean League consider you to be an independent operator with a set of League-guaranteed commerce rights within their controlled volume. You can trade and travel freely so long as you use a transponder, respect tariffs, and adhere to commodity restrictions.

[Line 733] Officials of the Persean League consider you to be an independent operator with a set of League-guaranteed commerce rights within their controlled volume. Your noteworthy independent fleet makes some smaller members wary and others respectful.

[Line 734] Officials of the Persean League consider you to be an independent operator with a set of League-guaranteed commerce rights within their controlled volume. Controlling your own colony has made you notable as a potential partner.

[Line 735] You have been tagged as a person of interest by the Persean League federal apparatus, subject to additional inspection and verification upon port entry. The gens of Kazeron are hesitant to deal with you preferring to do necessary business through intermediaries.

[Line 736] The PLFIS has flagged you as an involved party in suspicious and/or criminal activity. You are denied permission to trade in League world markets, and patrols will treat you as a potential threat, though they do not have shoot-on-sight orders from Fleet command. Yet.

[Line 737] Patrols of the Persean League have orders to 'engage at opportunity' if your fleet is spotted, considering you no better than a pirate. Markets of League Worlds are closed to you, and it is rumored that the gens of Kazeron are cooking up plans to be rid of your nuisance once and for all.

[Line 738] You are a scourge of the spaceways, declared enemy of the Persean League and its free citizens. More concerning, however, is that the great gens of Kazeron are willing to put aside their differences to pool resources to hunt you down.

[Line 739] You are rumored to be an agent for Gens Yaribay of Kazeron.

[Line 740] You are trusted and valued by $theFaction, green-lit by patrols and port authorities alike, and have considerable access to high-level officials. You are given much leeway, and may receive trade concessions and access to high-quality ships and munitions.

[Line 741] You are well known to the Hegemony, and admired. Officers respect your steadfastness and civilian personnel appreciative of your honest dealing. Functionaries learn that not every rule applies to you, and that you are trusted with restricted military hardware.

[Line 742] Your integrity is known in the Hegemony bureaucracy, earning you respect from officers and the welcome of civilian personnel. There is willingness to sell you certain restricted materiel and forgo some of the more tedious inspections.

[Line 743] You have earned a begrudging respect from the Hegemony bureaucracy. Officers tend to be less strict with you, though this has few practical implications. At best you might be sold low-grade surplus equipment and avoid being the target of a quota-meeting investigation.

[Line 744] You're not generally well known by $faction officials, for good or ill.

[Line 745] Though nothing has been proven (yet), $faction officials tend to view you with distrust. Link access to the port authority is granted only grudgingly, and you find yourself the subject of investigations and harassment frequently.

[Line 746] Suspicions have risen to an actionable level. There's no shoot-on-sight authorization quite yet, but $faction ports will refuse to trade with you, and patrols seem on a mission to make your life miserable.

[Line 747] $Faction commanders have authorization to engage your fleet on sight, and all markets are prohibited from trading with you. You might still recover good standing with $theFaction, but it's going to take some serious work.

[Line 748] A holo of your face and an IDENT-hash of your last known fleet are both regular parts of inter-system security bulletins. It's fairly certain there's a high-ranking $faction officer whose primary assignment is to hunt you down.

[Line 749] Your meeting with the High Hegemon is a topic of speculation among the higher ranks.


------------------------------
customs inspection
------------------------------
[Line 752] You receive a long-range comm burst from the $faction $otherFleetName directing your $shipOrFleet to come to and prepare for a customs inspection.
The message contains a standard legal-code attachment detailing the various penalties for evading customs agents, transporting contraband, and other related offenses.
It's as likely as not that this is nothing more than a legalized shakedown, but it has the weight of $faction authority behind it.

You begin to sense an air of sarcasm as $heOrShe continues, "... Because now I get to tell everyone that I got the chance to tell you to suck vacuum!"

[Line 1004] Pitted by small impacts, the probe's hull displays iridescence typical of fearsome radiation scarring. Though this probe's manufacture could well date to a thousand cycles ago, some systems are still nominally active.

[Line 1005] The ancient Domain-era automated survey ship has been ravaged by centuries of exposure to charged particles and high velocity impacts of interstellar dust. Some systems still appear to be nominally active.

[Line 1006] The vast bulk of the automated exploration mothership is burned and battered by centuries of service to the Domain, a drifting forgotten hulk, though sensors indicate that some systems are still nominally active.

[Line 1007] The form matches the general pattern of Domain-era mining station designs, but with absolutely no provisions made for human occupation. No hab ring, no life support module, no shuttle receiving bays.
Instead, inactive drone rigs cluster around the ring-trusses. Ore receiving bays lay dark; an agglomeration of zero-G fabricators sprouts from the central spire over the tiers of darkened hangars and warehouses.
Despite the darkened exterior, sensors reports a mix of minor energy readings and the gentle ticking of particles which suggest a stock of concentrated transplutonics.

[Line 1008] Sensor returns indicate unusually short-lived charged particles near the derelict. Density distribution in the internal structure has also changed from patterns extrapolated from your previous encounters with Domain-era exploration vessels, as if internal masses have been removed or intentionally redistributed.

Intro to Pilgrim's Path mission
------------------------------
[Line 1078] You notice a young novice watching you. As you accidentally meet their eyes, their smile widens; target acquired. They approach, keen on proselytization to a spacer captain.
These enthusiastic missionaries are a common enough affliction of spacedocks, so you are not unprepared. As they first draw breath to speak, you seize the initiative and say-

[Line 1079] Without making eye contact, you notice one of those youthful proselytizing types attempting to engage with the occasional hard-case spacer. If you wanted to chat, you'd only have to give the subtlest sign and they'd be filling your ears with hymns of Ludd.
Behind, a humbly yet splendidly robed shadow lurks in a candle-lit alcove. The shrine's Curate, you must assume.

[Line 1079] [Options Given: lpp_hookStart2:Why not. Look over to the young missionary.
lpp_hookLeaveA:Keep walking]

[Line 1084] [Option Selected: Why not. Look over to the young missionary.]
As you meet their eyes, their smile widens; target acquired. They approach, keen to recite the unabridged Sacred Texts of Ludd to you.
They first draw breath to speak and you seize the initiative to say-

[Line 1085] [Options Given: lpp_hookPolite:"Thank you, but I'm already familiar with your religion."]

[Line 1086] [Options Given: lpp_hookLearn:"I'd like to learn more about your faith."]

[Line 1087] [Options Given: lpp_hookYesAnd:"I have felt myself drawn to the Path."]

[Line 1088] [Options Given: lpp_hookTroll:"I'm a strong supporter of AI rights."]

[Line 1089] [Options Given: lpp_hookNope:"Not interested. Bye." ]

[Line 1090] [Option Selected: "Not interested. Bye."]
Their mouth shuts, attack-routine shunting to another approach pattern in response to your spoiling feint, then opens again. 
"If-" they begin, but you've already turned away.


[Line 1091] [Option Selected: "Thank you, but I'm already familiar with your religion."]
Your polite rebuff only kindles their pious urge to engage. 
"So you've already heard the Good News," the novice says eagerly. "Blessed are you in the eyes of Ludd, already and truly. Do you count yourself among the Faithful or has a sense of spiritual longing brought you to this shrine?"

[Line 1091] [Options Given: lpp_hookLearn1:"I was simply curious about the shrine."
lpp_hookLearn:"I... may have some spiritual questions."
lpp_hookWalkAlready:"You misunderstand; I already walk the Path."
lpp_hookAntiTech1:"No. What good is a religion that hates technology?"
lpp_hookNope:"Sorry, but I'm busy. Very busy. Good-bye."]

[Line 1092] [Option Selected: "You misunderstand; I already walk the Path."]
"Oh! Pardon my presumption, $playerBrotherOrSister. May... may I pray with you for a safe journey through the holy vacuum?" 
The novice perhaps asked this rhetorically, for they're already clasping their hands, eyes closed, and calling for submission before divine providence that you may navigate holy Creation to better serve in carrying out Ludd's teachings, and so on.

[Line 1093] [Option Selected: Join the novice in prayer]
You join the novice in prayer, repeating the words as best you can with hands clasped. At first it feels silly to partake in this naive ritual led by a cloistered child of the Church. It is like a lamb leading the lion. 
And yet.
Perhaps there is value in the unblushing faith held by such an innocent.
When the prayer finishes, the novice beams a bright smile at you. Behind, you notice that the shrine's Curate Sacraria - the priest of highest authority here - has been watching your exchange from a candle-lit alcove.

[Line 1093] [Options Given: lpp_hookCurateStart:Continue]

[Line 1094] [Option Selected: Pretend to join the novice in prayer]
You keep quiet and let the youth rattle on while you get in a good eye-roll. 
Letting out a sigh, you happen to spot the shrine's Curate Sacraria, the priest of highest authority here, watching your interaction from a candle-lit alcove. They make eye contact and raise an eyebrow.

[Line 1094] [Options Given: lpp_hookCurateStart:Continue]

[Line 1095] [Option Selected: Politely pretend to join the novice in prayer]
You politely hold your hands together and mumble something prayer-like, taking a moment to appreciate the poetry of the quoted scripture despite the naive delivery.
When the prayer finishes, the novice beams a bright smile at you. Behind them, you notice that the shrine's Curate Sacraria - the priest of highest authority here - has been watching your exchange from a candle-lit alcove.

[Line 1097] [Option Selected: "I... may have some spiritual questions.";['lpp_hookLearn1']]
"Wonderful! Blessed already are those whose spirit of reason calls them to the Church."
This is everything they could have hoped for, everything they've been training for. You're given an earful and more about sin, forgiveness, redemption, and the spiritual salve of a simple life. Lots about walking a path and stories about how all sorts of people were impressed with things Ludd said and did.
The novice winds down, and, noticing your endurance flagging, says "May... may I pray with you for a safe journey through the holy vacuum?"

#"It's a good story, but... it sounds like a story."]

[Line 1098] [Option Selected: "I have felt myself drawn to the Path."]
"Oh, praise Ludd!" the novice exclaims, "That you would be so drawn to spiritual salvation, $playerBrotherOrSister. May... may I pray with you for a safe journey through the holy vacuum?"

lpp_hookLeaveB:Just walk away]

[Line 1099] [Option Selected: "I'm a strong supporter of AI rights."]
This stops the novice short with a look just this side of panic. It is as if hearing you blaspheme so might sully their own faith. You notice their hands unconsciously motion a sign of contrition.
"Ah, that is not- pardon me, I mean to say, 'Blessed are the ignorant', so Ludd said, 'that they might be led on their first steps toward the path to righteousness.' And I believe that, t-truly," the novice stammers.
You see movement now, from the candle-lit alcove behind the novice.

[Line 1099] [Options Given: lpp_hookCurateStart:Continue]

[Line 1100] [Option Selected: "No. What good is a religion that hates technology?"]
The novice seems to brighten up at this. "It's actually a misunderstanding that the teachings of Ludd are anti-technological, after all..." They see the look on your face at the threat of another scripture reading. 
"Ahem. In other words, we believe the problem with advanced technology is not necessarily intrinsic. Well, some technologies are abhorrent- planet-killers, mind-interfacing, crass immortality. Anyway, the six industrial sins are committed when the human spirit is corrupted by technology used without virtue."

[Line 1100] [Options Given: lpp_hookAntiTech2:Continue]

[Line 1101] [Option Selected: Continue]
Point made, they nod emphatically. "You fly a space-ship, right? There are many good reasons to do this. To deliver charity, to unite families, to feed the hungry..."
The novice rattles off some extremely optimistic scenarios, and you're forced to concede - to yourself - that it's not unlikely that some of these causes have been inadvertently served in the course of your career.

[Line 1101] [Options Given: lpp_hookCurateStart:Continue]

[Line 1102] "Oh, no, $playerSirOrMadam. Blessed are the outcast, downtrodden, and forgotten. On our path, not one is left behind," the novice is looking truly concerned, and you suspect that they took your words the wrong way. 
"You are not a waste," they carry on in a torrent, "The Church embraces all who hear the spiritual call to light. May I... May I pray for you?"


[Line 1103] "I, um. Yes. I'm sorry," $heOrShe says sheepishly. "During training, we don't talk to a lot of... unbelievers." $HeOrShe looks up at you, "I mean no offense. And I remember now, the curate said we had to remember to relate to people on their terms, just like the prophet." Then to $himOrHerself, "I can't believe I'm being so stupid."

[Line 1104] [Option Selected: Take this opportunity to sneak away]
"Wait," says the novice, "I-"
And you're gone.

[Line 1105] [Option Selected: Just walk away]
"Oh," says the novice, "I-"
And you're gone.

[Line 1109] [Option Selected: Continue]
As if on cue - or perhaps because they were hovering nearby the whole time - the curate of the shrine steps up to you and the novice.

[Line 1110] "That's quite enough, my child," they say with iron concealed beneath soft words, "Perhaps you should undertake a prayer of contrition in the chapel while I speak with the captain."
Abashed, the novice bows and flees. The curate turns to you, face worn with lines of more than just patience.

[Line 1111] "Ah, the blessed faith of the young," the curate dismisses the novice with a nod. "Forthright and, I'm afraid, tactless."
"My name is $personName, and I am entrusted with the care of this shrine. I felt called to personally welcome you, captain."

"You are welcome here," the curate calls to you as you go. "Always."

The curate smiles. "You have my welcome whether you have come for faith or not."

[Line 1122] [Option Selected: "Thank you. It's very nice."]
"Perhaps your interest here is purely secular?" The curate smiles a little, then says "You have my welcome whether you come with faith or not."

[Line 1123] [Option Selected: "It's good to finally talk to an adult."]
"Forgive them their youth," the curate says with a sad smile. "We live it but once."

[Line 1124] [Option Selected: "Blessings be, curate."]
The curate smiles a little. "You speak already as if you walk among the Faithful. But as Ludd said, 'The truth of words is revealed by where stands the speaker.'"

[Line 1125] [Option Selected: "I bet you use that line with everyone."]
"Yes." The curate smiles a little, "Yes, I do. You have caught me out from atop a world-weary wall built around your soul."

[Line 1126] [Option Selected: "What do you mean 'called'?"]
The curate smiles a little. Is $heOrShe hiding something behind $hisOrHer display of piety?

A pause, then, "And also those who are not pilgrims." $HeOrShe looks expectantly at you, $hisOrHer silence asking which one you are - pilgrim or not?

"Then you may rest certain that you have come to the right place," the curate says warmly.

[Line 1137] [Option Selected: "How do you know I'm not a pilgrim?"]
The curate nods. "A fair rebuke. It is simply that you do not look like a pilgrim to me. I should not be so rigid of mind."

[Line 1140] The curate nods. "Each person finds expression of spirit in their own way. That is the beauty of the gift of consciousness. Or," $heOrShe adds with a wink, "Its evolution, as you may prefer."

[Line 1144] [Option Selected: "Tell me about this place.";['lpp_hookCurateAgnosticOut']]
$HeOrShe clears $hisOrHer throat, then gives a practiced speech: "Taken together, these shrines form the Pilgrim's Path. It is not merely a linear path through space. Though of course," $heOrShe takes a patient tone, "In secular use the name has been given to the major shipping lanes between Church and Hegemony-controlled volumes." 
The curate continues, "The Pilgrim's Path is a spiritual journey unique to each individual as they explore and discover their faith through our shared teachings, the holy Word gifted to us by the Creator who touched the prophet Ludd. The faithful are encouraged to make a pilgrimage at least once in their life, if they are able."

"Ye... es," the curate says, eyeing you skeptically.
"I'm sure," $heOrShe continues charitably, "that charging a nominal fare for fuel, air, and foodstuff would not be wholly out of line. The faithful would not expect you to beggar yourself to provide safe transport."

The curate smiles at your words. "Yes, to do so would be a praiseworthy service."

[Line 1149] [Option Selected: "I would like to visit the shrines."]
"Might you indeed," the curate says with a small smile. "Even to a secular visitor they represent wonders both beautiful and terrible of human and natural aspects of Creation."

The attendant receives your request with only the subtlest disapproval. To your surprise, a subcurate approaches to escort you to the shrine's viewing chamber.
A vast, dim gallery opens upon a hundred-meter diamond plate window allowing a full view of the glory of Kumari Aru. Here, pilgrims quietly contemplate the miracle of Creation, taking in the sublime and terrible beauty of the gas giant looming below. Storm systems the size of a standard terrestrial world churn with slow majesty, inner-lit with green-violet sheet lightning, teeming with xenolife.
Does something incomprehensible look up from the lee of a dark cloudbank at the bright point in that alien sky?

Deorbiting to the surface of Gilead is strictly overseen by the Knights of Ludd; your shuttle must queue behind a flotilla of lumbering transports and haulers filled with approved industrial goods.
This provides you with time to contemplate the face of Gilead; its continents, once fringed only by alien algae-equivalents, were seeded with Earth-life by a far-roving sporeship of the second wave of human expansion. The Eridani-Utopia Terraforming megacorp followed and its vast machines stabilized the climate and ecological processes. Ludd came then, pulled down the machines, and the believers who followed maintained the world as a garden-wilderness of astounding richness. Truly, it is a gem of the Persean Sector.

[Line 1215] The face of Gilead is painted with fragile green continents and glittering blue oceans. Ludd came here and the original Faithful, undiluted by the Church hierarchy, liberated the world from Eridani Utopia's terraforming machines. In place of a sprawl of private fortress-plantations and crowded resort playgrounds for the rich, a garden-wilderness of astounding richness bloomed. It is a gem of the Persean Sector.

[Line 1217] The face of Gilead bears startlingly green continents and glittering blue oceans. First seeded by sporeships, the terraforming contract was granted by the Domain colonial authorities to the Eridani Utopia Terraforming megacorporation. Their vast machines tamed the world, and just as the project was on the cusp of fruition, Ludd came. From a certain perspective, the followers of Ludd stole the world to create their own vision of paradise: a rustic garden-wilderness. Despite the hypocrisy, or perhaps for it, Gilead is a gem of the Persean Sector.

[Line 1234] [Option Selected: Ask about the shrine]
The attendant dutifully explains that the shrine commemorates the holy site where Ludd first stepped onto Gilead and was brought prostrate, to the shock of non-believers, to kiss the earth itself, so overcome was Ludd by the rapturous touch of Divinity.
Ludd's influence spread by its own evident virtue, the attendant explains, and the industrial terraforming machines were brought down and flowers bloomed in the rubble. There is no mention of strikes, global storms, sabotage, apocalyptic flooding and heatwaves, or corporate terror squads in this narrative. Nor does the attendant mention that, technically, an entire planet owned by the Eridani Utopia Terraforming megacorporation was illegally occupied by a radical cult. Rather, the unbelievers wept as Ludd revealed their sins and told them forgiveness was within reach on this garden-world.
It is an appealing morality tale delivered earnestly.

[Line 1235] [Option Selected: Visit the shrine]
The attendant nods, explaining that you must leave your guards behind because this is a place of peace, and all are equal on the Pilgrim's Path. 
The request is an implied request for keeping up appearances: a couple of your guards, unarmed and trained for situations requiring this degree of subtlety, attend to your safety as per matter of course. You note other unusually small parties of "pilgrims", plainly but clearly wealthy by their cut and carriage, led by their own shrine-attendants and accompanied by unusually muscled 'distant cousins'.
Nonetheless, the crowds filing out of the transport complex, on a wide highway of beaten earth and cobble, are enormous. Those that cannot walk are carried; no powered transport is provided.

[Line 1236] [Option Selected: Walk the path]
The path of the pilgrims leads up a slope covered in trees more enormous than any you've seen before. Though small in scale compared to the celestial phenomena that is your daily bread, their living architecture forms a natural cathedral.
Dispassionate Knights of Ludd watch as attendants shuttle you through a cordoned path in an arc through a final grove of mighty sequoia-analogs atop the promontory at the terminus of the ridge - it is a temple, struts and spars intertwined with the trees. Golden sunlight filters through heavy branches, and as the breeze lifts a whispering chorus of foliage, you catch an earthy scent over the mass of humanity surrounding you.

And in a moment, it passes.

It is a smaller path you are led down; not the highway of humanity for the main shrine, this is a smaller, secondary shrine in the lee of a crag dominated by the immense forest.
Pilgrims are offered tea, and water, and ritual washing. The air is filled with sweat, incense, and the scent of pine. A thrum of odd chanting distorted by the breeze lifts and wanes by the whims of the air currents.
You see shrine curates blessing pilgrims. Soon it is your turn.

The curate casts scented drops and says the words, though it is almost a blur. It is strange to have come so far, for this.

[Line 1249] All around you see despair and decadence in equal measure channelled into the elaborate rituals of the Luddic Church. Made safe, made convenient; an insulating layer that allows people to live without truly walking Ludd's Path.
It is easy to forget here in the proud edifice of the Church that Ludd held a hammer, too, and was unafraid to use it without hesitation in the face of evil.

[Line 1250] Around you flows a river of faith and ritual. Your fellow pilgrims have chosen their purpose to pursue, that of Ludd's message. In the collective hardship of life in the Persean Sector, as in the collective hardship of the pilgrimage, they find a kind of peace and meaning that is absent in the hollow left by the Collapse.

[Line 1251] Around you people put on the motions of pilgrimage and ritual, play-acting the forms of great meaning for their prophet Ludd. It is almost unbelievable what has been built on the intentionally obfuscated rantings of one rabble-rouser. It is impossible to know what Ludd would made of all this.
The Church, of course, makes a good show of pretending to, and it prospers for it.

[Line 1252] Around you flows a river of pilgrims. They've invested such meaning into the journey they've made, supposedly in the path of their prophet Ludd. It is almost unbelievable how much has been built on the words of one obscure figure who managed to be blessed by circumstance with great charisma and a moment to bend the arc of history.
What would the - certainly - long-dead Ludd make of what's become of all of it?

The Knight simply makes a small bow in acknowledgement of your description of the Archurate. You suppose they're being politic.

[Line 1260] [Option Selected: "What's this about?"]
"I know not. It is my duty to extend this hospitality on behalf of the Reverend Archcurate," the Knight says, then with a thought adds, "You are accused of no heresy, or secular crime. Your safety is my duty." 

[Line 1262] [Option Selected: "I decline the invitation.";['lpp_endingKnightAllowed']]
The Knight's eyebrows shoot up in surprise. With a blink the Knight recovers composure, and says "Y... es. Of course. This is a request, not a demand. Although. The Reverend Archcurate." A moment's pause. "She suggested that I insist, if necessary." 
Beneath the solemnity, the Knight's look pleads for you to not put them in the awkward situation of denying the Archcurate. 
You mentally review your model of the Church hierarchy: the Archcurate Conclave is the crown of the Church, meeting or sending representatives to perform the rulings that determine the highest matters; interpreting the canon of Ludd, sanctification, holy law, excommunication. If the Church has rulers, this Archcurate is among them.

[Line 1264] [Option Selected: "I've changed my mind. Lead on."]
You are led by the Knight through gardens and the soaring arcades of Luddic Church architecture: half-remembered dreams of gothic cathedrals given flight by the material science of the Domain. It might be thought impertinent to mention this aspect of the construction, of course.
The Knight-Initiate follows behind, footsteps echoing between arched portals, over slate tiles flecked with glittering pyrite like stars in the night.

[Line 1265] [Option Selected: "Does every successful pilgrim get to meet the Archcurate?"]
The Knight looks back at you, half-cape fluttering over carefully secured weaponry, with an expression that yours is a stupid question. The tone of the reply is firmly neutral, however.
"No, captain. The Reverend Archcurate requested a meeting with you specifically."

[Line 1266] [Option Selected: "Why am I receiving this treatment?"]
"I know not, captain, and could not say," the Knight says crisply, eyes forward.

[Line 1267] [Option Selected: Say nothing]
You pass through wooden doors and halls carpeted in designs of foliage and fauna, presumably of Old Earth: a fawn, a whale; hawks and dragons circling in a blue sky wreathed with leaves of ivy, oak, and palm.
The Archcurate's office appears relatively austere at first glance, but as your eyes adjust, hand-carved wooden paneling emerges, their faces packed with small plants and figures both human and animal. The room is situated to overlook a private atrium-garden. A shaft of sunlight illuminates flowers and catches the softly trickling drops of a fountain.

"Your Excellency," the Knight calls out too loudly for the space, and bows to the figure within.
The Archcurate Jaspis turns toward you, closing a thick book.
"Come before me, captain," she says. "I would share with you a pot of tea, and my hospitality. Knight Ailanthus, you have my thanks and may leave us be."

She scoffs. "Oh, so after right and truly blundering the greeting I laid before you, now you are the master of Church affairs? Even I can see plain how you've made such an impression on the ecumene."

[Line 1272] [Option Selected: "It is my policy not to owe anyone anything."]
"As charming of wit and tongue as hearsay suggested, you must enliven celebration and negotiation in equal part. Even now I find my own self contemplating the necessity of bothering to show hospitality at all."

[Line 1273] Option(s) Selected: ['lpp_ending4Speak']
She grabs the long handle of the carafe. "Drink the tea or not. I shall now make it," she says, and gaze still unfocused, fills the teapot.
She is quite blind, you realize.

[Line 1274] [Option Selected: "Water will do."]
"Then I share with you water drawn from the well of my home, and my hospitality with it," she says, all part of the ritual. She gets up and retrieves the pitcher of water, placing it next to the tea pot. 
Her gaze is still unfocused. She is quite blind, you realize, as she  takes the handle of the carafe of boiling water, and without looking, fills the teapot.

[Line 1275] [Option Selected: Sit and have some tea]
She takes the handle of the carafe of boiling water, and without looking, gaze still unfocused, fills the teapot.
She is quite blind, you realize.

[Line 1277] [Options Given: lpp_ending6:"Why did you invite me here?" ]

[Line 1281] [Option Selected: "You're blind."]
"That even I can see," she says without hesitation. "We both bear burdens with the grace the Creator saw fit to provide; for one, I give thanks that I was not made a boor."
She returns the carafe to the heating element, centering it perfectly.

[Line 1282] "Have water, if you will. My tea will be but a moment."

[Line 1283] "Let us give the tea a moment, child."

[Line 1284] [Option Selected: Drink some water]
You pour yourself some water and have a sip. It is cold, and it is good. 
It is almost disturbingly unlike the water from your own ship, purified from cometary ice, generally, and infused with certain standard additives.

[Line 1285] [Option Selected: "Why did you invite me here?"]
She smiles thinly.

[Line 1287] "You made pilgrimage to the holy shrines of Ludd, you have made affinity with the Church and held compassion for the Faithful." She picks up a teacup and idly taps the side.
"'In my right hand I hold the hammer as my left is open for you to take.'" She says, quoting the Book of Ludd. "The hammer has place alongside the heart."

[Line 1287] [Options Given: lpp_ending8:Continue]

[Line 1288] "You made pilgrimage to the holy shrines of Ludd. A taxing act to which the Faithful aspire. Yet you also take pain to keep distance from the Church, to hold nothing holy." She picks up a teacup and taps its side idly.
"I have not received you here to admonish or proselytize. If a struggle bedevils your soul, or if it is deaf to the songs of Creation, then that matter is for your own prayer and meditation."

[Line 1288] [Options Given: lpp_ending8:Continue]

[Line 1289] "You made pilgrimage to the holy shrines of Ludd, and yet you treat the Church with face dark and averted, speaking cutting words with false jocularity. You are bereft of affinity for the nicety of manners without suffering the years to earn that exalted state." She picks up a teacup and taps its side idly. 
"A question sits restless in my mind: is your inclination a life of misjudgment led by directionless passion?"

[Line 1289] [Options Given: lpp_ending8:Continue]

[Line 1290] "The militancy of your zeal has its admirers among the Faithful, but there is question that you are overquick to raise the hammer of wrath when the righteous path is oft led by the heart, and humbly so." 
She picks up a teacup and taps its side idly.
"And yet, 'In my right hand I hold the hammer as my left is open for you to take.'" She says, quoting the Book of Ludd. "The hammer has a place."

[Line 1290] [Options Given: lpp_ending8:Continue]

[Line 1291] [Option Selected: Continue]
"The office I am entrusted to has need for the service of an actor of means and ability."
More quietly, her voice gone low and rough, "A hammer."
The Archcurate places her teacup back on the desk, exactly where it was before, then pours tea into her cup, and then into yours.

[Line 1292] She either ignored or forgot your desire for water instead of tea. You strongly suspect it is the former.

[Line 1293] [Options Given: lpp_jaspisWhatDo:"So you want me to be your 'hammer'?"]

[Line 1294] [Options Given: lpp_jaspisWhatGoal:"I mean what do you want? What is your goal?"]

[Line 1301] [Options Given: lpp_jaspisAskCotton:"Your message for Brother Cotton is a leaf?"]

[Line 1302] [Option Selected: "Your message for Brother Cotton is a leaf?"]
"It is," she says simply. "Let that be the end of it for now."

[Line 1303] [Option Selected: "Don't you have the Knights of Ludd for this?"]
She smiles sardonically. "You have met the Knights. You know full well that in all matters they will break rather than bend and name such waste 'sacrifice'."
"I should not speak so broadly however. There is one who was sent to me to serve for his noviceship. He is the one I want you to find."

[Line 1304] [Option Selected: "You remind me of Provost Baird."]
"Do you insult or laud me, I wonder," she says. "Anahita Baird is a powerful woman, intelligent and proud. She also makes herself habit of knocking upon the doors of demons." She sits back, cradling her teacup.
"Or I should say, rather, she sends others to knock in her place." The Archcurate waves a hand dismissively, "I hold not your work for her against your character. If I may return your Janus-faced compliment: what you have done for Baird may even prove more your suitability for what is in my mind."

[Line 1305] [Option Selected: "So you want me to be your 'hammer'?"]
"No. My hammer is," she nods in your direction, "a humbler being by far than you. But he requires aid in his quest, and for that you might well serve."
She sips some tea, "Do understand that I speak not entirely of war and wrath. A hammer may strike subtly, even quietly, if aimed with skill, wisdom, and piety."

[Line 1306] [Option Selected: "I mean what do you want? What is your goal?"]
"The Faith has many enemies, both within and without the Church," she says slowly. "Some know what evil they do; others do not. They must be set right."
"I would labor to do good as Ludd taught us, and by all means available, as Ludd also taught us. In doing good, I serve this office. And to greater purpose, I serve the vision Ludd handed down to us."

[Line 1307] [Option Selected: "A job offer. I should have known"]
She takes a leisurely moment to sip her tea.
"You will of course be paid. The coffers of the Church are not so abundant as Tri-Tachyon's plunder, but if these credits may service a righteous path, let us not cast them aside."
"Such acts are for saints." She smiles a little, "Not for those such as you and I."

[Line 1308] [Option Selected: "I would be blessed to be of service to the Church."]
"The Church," she says, "might reward such zealousness."
A wry smile appears, "Would one place faith in the machinery of offices, of rules and letters and who-serves-whom? I pray that we do not grow our own demon in Ludd's good name."
"Worry not." She leans back, "My advanced age allows me to say such things that could have a novice excommunicated."

[Line 1309] [Option Selected: "I'm not sure you appreciate how hard the Hammer must fall."]
"I understand full well that you wish untempered wrath let loose in the cause of holy justice, captain."
Her blind eyes seem fixed on you.
"Let me provide you a channel for your river of tears and blood. Otherwise the products of all that suffering might be spilled directionless, wasted."

[Line 1310] [Option Selected: "I'm not sure you appreciate how hard the Hammer must fall."]
The Archcurate reaches under her desk then places a book on the pitted surface. It is the holy book of Ludd given to you by Brother Cotton; you had left it as an offering at the shrine, amongst a mountain of trinkets.
That she has it here, and knows you put it there, suggests much about the capabilities of the Church and the attention being paid to you.
"I understand full well that you wish untempered wrath let loose to wreak holy justice, captain." Her blind eyes seem fixed on you. "At least, you have communed with one who does."

[Line 1310] [Options Given: lpp_jaspisHammerFall2:Continue]

[Line 1311] [Option Selected: Continue]
She turns to a small side-shelf, opens a wooden box, and takes out a delicate, desiccated leaf.
"Do you know Ludd's Parable of the Kudzu?" She carefully opens Cotton's book, places the leaf within, closes it, and pushes it toward you.
She leans forward, then says in a harsh whisper, "Take it to him. We will speak of this later."

[Line 1312] The Archcurate carefully puts her hands together, not unlike a position of prayer.
"Captain. Allow me to put the matter to you directly."

[Line 1312] [Options Given: lpp_jaspisWrapUp2:Continue]

[Line 1313] "My hammer is," she nods in your direction, acknowledging something, "a humbler thing by far than yourself. But he requires aid in his quest, and for that you might well serve."

[Line 1314] "My agent is a novice of the Knights of Ludd. He was assigned to my office in order to achieve his Knighthood. He infiltrated a cell of heretical militants affiliated with the ill-named Luddic Path. I have not heard from him in some time." 
Her voice, usually somewhere between confident and sardonic, almost breaks on these last few words.

"If you accept this task from my office, my assistant will provide you with identity files to aid you in finding my agent. You will also be given a modest retainer to fund your efforts, and more if... when you find him."
"You need not answer now. Pray on the matter. Or 'ponder' if that is how you would name it."
She turns back to the book she had open when you entered. "May Providence favor you with a blessed path; I pray it returns to me with an answer in the affirmative."

She hrums in acknowledgement, attention focused elsewhere now, opening her book with one hand and placing the other upon its open face.

[Line 1317] [Options Given: lpp_jaspisWrapUp5:Leave]

[Line 1318] [Option Selected: "I have already decided."]
"With such haste?" she says, "You need not play-act enthusiasm to impress me. My opinion has always held that decisions of great import should be given ample time to steep."
"Gift me now with silence," she says as she opens her book with one hand and places the other upon its open face.

[Line 1318] [Options Given: lpp_jaspisWrapUp5:Leave]

[Line 1319] [Option Selected: "Do not expect me to run errands for the Church."]
"Your posturing is best held within, captain." 
She opens her book with one hand and places the other upon its open face, "Then diffused through meditation," she says.
After a moment she adds, "Unless self-flagellation is your preferred expression of zeal. I judge not."

[Line 1319] [Options Given: lpp_jaspisWrapUp5:Leave]

[Line 1320] [Option Selected: Leave]
You leave Archcurate Jaspis to her book.
A soft-spoken attendant in robes makes an incongruous datapad appear and coordinates transfer of the Archcurate's comms ID - at least, for her office - then passes you off to the blank-faced Knight Ailanthus to escort you to your waiting shuttle. 
Your return to orbit is uneventful.

[Line 1326] [Option Selected: Take a shuttle to visit the Luddic shrine]
With the flash of official iconography, instructions are returned from the orbital navigation service which attempts to track the innumerable human-made artifacts of the Volturnian sea - floating habitats, sprawling farm envelopes, transient mining platforms, and even ancient-style seafaring vessels.
Your shuttle pierces the atmosphere in a long descent arc, politely slowing to under the speed of sound as it approaches a bank of thick fog illuminated by Askonia's primary. What at first looks like an ethereal castle is revealed by proximity to be a dismal, jostling accretion of barges parasited to a retired extraction rig.

Your shuttle settles on the landing pad and is met by no one. Corroded mount-points remain where weapons emplacements once loomed.
The small Diktat garrison has been deployed elsewhere, you suppose, and the official you met given some new backwater assignment.

The shifty official meets your shuttle on the landing pad. Behind him, you spot temporary weapon emplacements and shield modules stamped with the crest of the Sindrian Diktat. Pale conscripts in battered armor eye you warily while they suck down narcotic smoke.

[Line 1330] [Option Selected: Continue]
You note, as you endure obsequious smalltalk, that the conscripts' equipment is as shabby and ill-maintained as your first visit. The official, however, appears to be wearing a stylish new suit not quite close enough to the official Lion's Guard uniform to attract official reprimand.
Past the checkpoint, you step through the heavy doors to the receiving hall of the shrine. Its emptiness is a welcome change of company.

A shifty official meets your shuttle on the landing pad. Behind him, you spot temporary weapon emplacements and shield modules stamped with the crest of the Sindrian Diktat. Pale conscripts in battered armor eye you warily while they suck down narcotic smoke.
The official produces a trembling facsimile of a smile and looks you up and down. 
"A, a pilgrim are you?" he asks unconvincingly. "I'm afraid the shrine is closed today. And tomorrow. Security concerns. The situation has been... unstable."

You return to your shuttle, taking a final breath of sea-air, the stink of rotten material that's encrusted itself on these platforms still in your nostrils.
The flight in your return shuttle is uneventful.

[Line 1341] [Option Selected: "I would like to visit the shrine."]
"I see," the official says, arms crossed. "It pains me to inform you that a visit is... quite impossible."
You reflect that he doesn't sound particularly pained, and it appears to be quite possible if he just let you walk through the doors.

[Line 1342] [Option Selected: "I must visit the shrine. I'm quite devout."]
"Hrm," the official rubs his hands together, "Your devotion to that quaint religion is not in doubt. It is simply that, ah, the Supreme Executor must be... reassured of the loyalty of the more, more... Luddic members of his empire before he allows them to return here."
The official's eyes are moist, but not from any compassion you can sense, "He yearns to allow free worship, but each time the Lion allows his compassion to guide his judgment it is, is abused." The official opens his hands apologetically.

[Line 1348] [Option Selected: Explain that you are on a secret mission from the Supreme Executor (lie)]
You lean in closer, hardening your expression. The official, confused but intrigued, follows your cue and leans in.
You demand, on his life, to know if he is a true follower of Admiral Philip Andrada, Supreme Executor; The Lion of Sindria; the leader of a great movement to purge degeneration from the system while constructing a new, proud Persean people to populate the Sector.
"Y-yes, of course," he says, trembling.
Then he must let you, a secret agent of the Lion's Guard, perform your mission.
"I'll have to... to confirm..." He starts fumbling for his datapad.

[Line 1349] [Option Selected: "That would be a terrible error."]

You cut him off by raising a finger.
He nods vigorously, flinging sweat. Blind loyalty fills his eyes.
"Yes. Yes, of course. You need to access... but of course. Taking care of the Luddic problem, the terrorists and- I knew it, I knew there was a plan! I'll tell no one. You can count on me."

The official nods, smooths out his uniform, then turns to the conscripts. "At attention!" he screams, sending them into a flurry of activity, dropping narcotic-sticks and grabbing for firearms.
He then marches proudly toward the shrine entrance, halts with a clack of boot-heel, and pivots - all in passable parade form.

[Line 1353] [Option Selected: Explain that you are commissioned by the Sindrian Diktat]
A datapad appears in the official's hand and he looks, squinting, between you and it several times.
"M-my humblest apologies, $playerSirOrMadam," the official stutters, "I should have been notified, made preparations," he looks around scattershot until his gaze catches on the conscripts.

[Line 1355] [Option Selected: "Perhaps a donation to local security forces will help?"]
A datapad appears in the official's hand and he looks, squinting to get a read on you. Are you a plant from internal security, a terrorist infiltrator? The options weigh on his face against his greed.

But even a father only has s-so many resources at his disposal... why, if we had the credits to purchase better armor for our brave young soldiers," he indicates the smoking conscripts, now having a spitting contest off the side of the landing platform.

The receiving hall is empty of pilgrims, and mostly dark. Hand-sewn banners hang limply, their bright colors muted in the gloom. Benches and tables lay empty.
You spot a light through a small doorway. The humble office of the curate sacraria, and within, an old woman asleep behind a pot of tea, still steaming, set out on the desk.

As you step in, she opens her eyes and after getting a good look, withdraws a pistol from where she held it under her mantle of hand-weave and places it in a holster.
"I could hardly shoot someone trying to be so polite about sneaking up on an old woman," she says, examining your uniform.

[Line 1365] [Option Selected: "Hello! I'd like the see the shrine!"]
She sighs at your outburst and opens her eyes - she seems too composed to have been truly sleeping - then withdraws the pistol which was held under her hand-weave and places it in a holster.
"I can hardly shoot you for interrupting the nap I wasn't having, now can I," she says.

As you step to the desk and pour a cup, she lets her eyes open and withdraws a pistol from her hand-weave. 
This she places in a holster.
"I'll hardly shoot you for being presumptuous over a cup of tea. So yes, do help yourself."

[Line 1367] [Option Selected: "If the tea is that hot, you can't really be asleep."]
She smiles as she withdraws the pistol she was holding beneath her hand-weave, opens her eyes, then places the pistol in a holster.
"Observant. If you're a goon, then I must say you're a higher grade than the usual. How may I serve?"

"It's just a pistol," she says. "It's not that heavy."

[Line 1378] [Option Selected: "I could report you for threatening a commissioned officer of the Sindrian Diktat."]
"You could," she admits, holding your gaze. "Do it or don't, I'm too old to dance around implied threats."
For the first time, she sips her tea. "I could be having that nap."

[Line 1379] [Option Selected: "Are you a member of the Volturn insurgency?"]
She looks at you for a long moment.
"No, officer. I am armed only to protect the shrine from looters and terrorists. You know how times are. The authority of the Supreme Executor is... stretched thin."
You detect more than a hint of disapproval in her eyes, but she knows when not to speak her mind.

[Line 1380] [Option Selected: "I mean, are you part of the Volturn insurgency?"]
She looks at you for a long moment.
"A long time ago, before... many things, the-one-who-would-be Ludd was hunted by the authorities of the Domain. They had electronic eyes everywhere, and hidden ears. But their multitude of small demons did not find the-one-who-would-be, who was hidden among friends and fellow travelers."
"And do you know why?"

[Line 1380] [Options Given: lpp_volturnCurateAskInsurgency2:Continue]

[Line 1381] [Option Selected: Continue]
"OPSEC," she says, kicking a table-leg, setting the tea-set clattering. "Ludd got betrayed in the end, of course, but what can you do? All good things and so on."
Letting out a sigh, she continues in a voice of spirited obedience: "No, officer, I've never heard of this insurgency. Sounds awful."

[Line 1382] [Option Selected: "Shouldn't you be talking about blessings?"]
She raises an eyebrow. "I could arrange a blessing if that's what you want."
She dips two fingers in a cup of tea and flings the droplets at you. "Blessed be this pilgrim before me, may they find grace on Ludd's path. May Providence be merciful in hardship, and if not, let them bow their head in humble prayer to their Creator, who made the stars all around, begging forgiveness for their sins, and for guidance on their path."
"There," she drops a hand on the table. "You're blessed."

[Line 1382] [Options Given: lpp_volturnCurateResponses:"Thanks, I think."]

[Line 1383] [Option Selected: "Shouldn't you be talking about blessings?"]
"I suppose I could arrange a blessing," she says slowly. 
"But the shrine is closed, didn't you hear? It would feel," she pretends to search for the words, "Disloyal."
The woman shrugs, open handed.

[Line 1384] [Option Selected: Drink the tea]
The tea is rich with umami. Less vegetal, more briney.
"A humble local variety," the woman says. "Tartessian Brown is hard to come by, what with the occupation."

[Line 1385] [Option Selected: "I'm here to see the shrine."]
"Then," she says, "I am here to show you to it." 
"Simon?" she says to someone behind you, "You may also put your gun away."
You turn to look and Simon does as she asks, giving you an apologetic little half-salute. The curate smiles, and with open hands shows you the way to the inner shrine.

[Line 1392] [Option Selected: Continue]
The curate leads you to the back of an entry hall and pulls back a heavy curtain. The metal rings attaching it to a rail above clatter, dropping flakes of rust.
Perhaps this is a shrine of humility?
It is a small thing set in the back of a back room, rows of candles are arrayed around the wooden centerpiece carved with images of Ludd's travails. The candles are all dead, but the place is illuminated by dim shafts of light let in by grimy portholes.
"We do not have many visitors, you see," the curate says.

"Appropriate, though. Reminds us of our place on this world."

[Line 1404] [Option Selected: "I sense a note of criticism in your tone."]
"Oh?" She raises an eyebrow at you. "Oh, alright. Lying is a sin, and redemption must begin somewhere."
She raises her chin and looks at you. "The shrine has been all but stomped out by your Sindrian Diktat. Soldiers and MuniSec harass pilgrims and arrest the faithful, then steal our tithes."
"As long as they leave the shrine untouched, however, the Church is willing to turn the other cheek."

[Line 1405] [Option Selected: "If the Church has abandoned you, why stay?"]
"My faith is not the Church," she says fiercely. "And they can defrock and excommunicate me for that if they like, it would change nothing here."

[Line 1406] [Option Selected: "A compromise, then. Private prayer, public support for the Executor."]
"This," she indicates the decrepit shrine around her, "Is the compromise. As dictated by your Executor."
"Any further, then we shall have left the path of Ludd's teachings entirely. So here I remain."

[Line 1407] [Option Selected: "If you accepted the Supreme Executor, it wouldn't have to be like this."]
"There's a suggestion," she says with false cheer. "We could put one of those holo portraits of Andrada right... here," she waves a hand at the center of the shrine. "Really focus our prayers, do some good."

[Line 1408] [Option Selected: "Why do you insist on being so stubborn and backward? I'm trying to help."]
"I will consider your position once I can put that same question to those of my flock that were sent to Cruor," she says.
"Until you can give them back," her eyes are bright with tears, "I will do as I do."

[Line 1409] [Option Selected: "I'll talk to someone on Cruor about your followers."]

[Line 1410] [Option Selected: Continue]
Not quite an hour later, you find yourself at the bottom of the sea, in the Luddic shrine of Volturn. It is a creaking and unnervingly humid inspection module at the end of a modified extraction stack; a metal proboscis thrust into the depths of Volturn.
It is also filled with guns, explosives, grenades, cellmags. Crates and racks are piled high, making the small space more cramped. A small shrine is set in an open space under a round diamond-matrix viewport which holds back a titanic mass of water. A few candles struggle to maintain even a decent flicker among the ranks of their dead comrades.
There are pilgrims here, of a sort. Their unwashed bodies smell of sweat and smoke, they speak and pray quietly. The curate sacraria re-lights a candle from one that is burning, and offers one for you to do the same.

lpp_volturnCurateTroubleShrine:"This is a shrine. Is it not a sacred place?"
lpp_volturnCurateTroubleHeavier:"Lack of heavy weapons. How will you fight armored targets?"]

[Line 1422] [Option Selected: "Are you part of the Luddic Path?"]
"No. Not at all." She gives you a look of some disgust. "I am a curate of the Church of Galactic Redemption. What I do and what they do are very different. I hope, I truly hope, you can see that."
Her gaze turns to the weapons, "I admit, there has been... contact. Each day is a test. I pray we do not stray too far from Ludd."

[Line 1423] [Option Selected: "This is a shrine. Is it not a sacred place?";['lpp_volturnCurateTroubleViolent']]
"The book does tell us 'Blessed are the peacemakers', yet," the curate looks at you with hard eyes, "Peace does not make itself."
"Ludd was no war-maker, but Ludd knew when to fight. By self-sacrifice, by martyrdom, did not Ludd deliver victory?"
She waves a hand dismissively. "This is rhetoric to you, perhaps. But to me, it is more simple: I will not let more of my flock be taken to the mines of Cruor as sacrifice to some tin-pot Lucifer."

[Line 1424] [Option Selected: "Lack of heavy weapons. How will you fight armored targets?"]
A smile doubles the wrinkles on her face. "I believe we understand one another."

[Line 1425] [Option Selected: "This seems to confirm your part in the insurgency."]
"I've made a believer of you," the curate smiles. "Good."

[Line 1426] [Option Selected: "What does the Church think of your part in this insurgency?"]
"The Church is not one mind, but the body of many brought together in council," she says. "Some support our work here with zeal, and some are content merely to pray."
A dark look comes over her, "I, however, pray that the united face of the Church might not turn from witnessing our suffering. Ludd wept unblinking, it is said; that the Fathers and Mothers of our Church would do the same."

[Line 1427] [Option Selected: Light the candle]
"So the torch is passed," the curate says. "Light of flame, light of faith."
She gives you a sly look, "Or it's just a candle."

[Line 1428] [Option Selected: "It is not just a candle."]
"The Pneuma lives in these words."
She is staring sadly, you think, at the candles before you.

[Line 1429] [Option Selected: "It is just a candle."]
For once, she does not answer.
She is staring sadly, you think, at the candles before you.

[Line 1430] [Option Selected: Look out the window for a moment]
Specks float on blue-black like stars in space in the light cast out into the crushing depths. It is an almost unsettling wrongness from a familiar image. Motes of something or other flick to and fro.
"Life prevails even here, under unthinkable oppression," the curate says. "Let us be thankful, too, for the ingenuity granted to us by Providence," she taps the pressure hull, which resounds dully. "See? We do not hate all technology."

Your shuttle follows the instructions of the orbital navigation service, piercing the atmosphere in a long arc of descent toward the Volturnian sea.
The shuttle slows to final approach speed near the destination coordinates, a bank of thick fog illuminated by Askonia's primary. What at first looks like an ethereal castle is revealed by proximity to be a dismal, jostling accretion of barges and ships surrounding the retired extraction rig which houses the shrine.

Curate Sacraria Standfast greets you with tea inside the echoing receiving hall before escorting you down to the inner shrine.
You enter the creaking, humid inspection module at the end of a modified extraction stack where the shrine is housed, against all reason. Crates and racks of weapons and ammunition are piled high, crowding the pilgrims/insurgents. Their unwashed bodies smell of sweat and smoke. They speak and pray quietly. 
The small shrine's centerpiece is set in an open space under a round diamond-matrix window holding back the crushing depths of the sea. A few candles flicker among the ranks of their dead comrades. As before, the curate sacraria re-lights a candle from one that is burning, and offers one for you to do the same.

Curate Sacraria Standfast coolly acknowledges your presence. She is armed with a small pistol, politely holstered but with the clasp impolitely loosed.
She is equal parts perplexed and annoyed when you request to see the shrine, but she draws back the dusty curtains for you and stands aside.
The shrine looks as abandoned as ever in this back room. Rows of unlit candles are arrayed around the wooden centerpiece carved with images of Ludd's travails. The place is illuminated only by dim shafts of light let in by grimy portholes.

Your shuttle descends toward the surface of Killa, following the landing beacon to the site of the shrine. A careless scattering of wrecked hulls and cold transport rovers form the graveyard of a long-past slaughter..
You follow the dusty footsteps of previous pilgrims to a humble airlock set into an escarpment of crumbling regolith.

[Line 1444] [Options Given: lpp_killaShrineVisitAgain1:Enter the airlock]

[Line 1445] [Option Selected: Take a shuttle to the Luddic Church beacon]
Your shuttle descends toward the surface of Killa, following the landing beacon to an ancient lava-sea peppered with craters.
Tactical systems log the brief ping of targeting radar but the signature suggests a handheld system too crude to pose a threat to your countermeasures.
The landing site is far from any obvious ruins or landmarks. There's just a smear of crumbling temporary habs and cold, broken transports.

[Line 1446] [Option Selected: Continue]
Your shuttle comes to a rest on the landing pad, easing softly into the microgravity. 
The wreckage and debris is not so chaotic as it seemed from orbit. A swarm of dusty footprints lead toward an airlock buried in an escarpment some distance away.
It appears that others have been using this site in the cycles since the war's devastation.

There are low-density voids beneath the surface; artificial density patterns. Caves or bunkers or tunnels. Ferric and non-ferric metals, some EM activity, some radioactivity.

[Line 1450] [Options Given: lpp_killaOssuary1:Step inside]

[Line 1451] [Option Selected: Step inside]
There is no interior atmosphere, at least none to speak of. Ghostly veils of dust flex and twist in the electrostatic fields of the shrine, strong enough to overcome the low gravity of this world to hang in the near-vacuum.
Instructions are given by some unnamed Luddic priest who recites his words into crude repeaters awoken by your activity:
"Come only in peace. Let rest the dead. We pray now in the words revealed to Ludd... "

[Line 1451] [Options Given: lpp_killaOssuary2:Look around]

[Line 1452] [Option Selected: Look around]
The ossuary is built from buried hulls, roughly welded in a chaotic but not artless architecture. No surface is quite level, and the original - faded, crumbling - icons and lettering belie forgotten functions. "Crew quarters", "attachment point", "purge before cycling".
In the gloom you begin to make out empty sockets, rib-cages, countless femurs and spines. They cluster in recesses, corners, in stowage spaces with hatches removed.
You realize that the dust in the air comes from the bodies, the bones, slowly crumbling around you.

[Line 1452] [Options Given: lpp_killaOssuary3:Continue]

[Line 1453] [Option Selected: Continue]
The unknown priest's words fill the radio-channels, made warbly and tinny by the low power of the repeaters.

You instinctively pull back, hand on your sidearm.
The figure pauses, adjusts something on its battered suit, and the helmet switches on its self-illumination. Its hands sign a channel ID, which you flick to.
"We have few visitors," says the same voice as the broadcast prayers, rough with age and disuse.
So this is what passes for the local Curate Sacraria.

He turns and moves, as if expecting you to follow.

[Line 1456] [Options Given: lpp_killaOssuaryBridge:Follow]

[Line 1457] [Option Selected: "I walk the Pilgrim's Path."]
The curate makes a sound in his throat; acknowledgement. You catch a glimpse of sad, dark eyes. "Then you walk with me. Come. A dark path. Company is welcome."
He turns and walks without hesitation into the folds of ruin.

[Line 1457] [Options Given: lpp_killaOssuaryBridge:Follow]

[Line 1458] [Option Selected: "There must be thousands of the dead here."]
The hollow eyes of the curate squint, unmoving for a moment. "No," he says in a voice warmed only little over interstellar medium. "The dead are numberless," the suit sags.
Then. with a grunt, he turns and walks as if expecting you to follow.

[Line 1458] [Options Given: lpp_killaOssuaryBridge:Follow]

[Line 1459] [Option Selected: Follow]
Moving deeper, between rooms and hulls, you witness galleries of the dead, bones and skulls carefully and artfully piled. You catch a glimpse now and then of pilgrims in ones and twos by their active vacsuit indicators. The curate leaves them to their contemplations.

[Line 1460] [Option Selected: ['lpp_killaOssuaryBridge2', '$saidShrine', '==', 'true']]
"They are forgotten," the curate says, his gaze passing across the bones. Taking stock, somehow. "But I will not forget them. And all who visit here, they will help me remember that those who died may live eternal."

The curate sacraria stops before a pedestal, a bouquet of spines topped by fragments of skull. You see the glint of a cranial implant among the shards. The curate carefully lifts a fragment, trailing gold wire.
"Death comes for all. Every warlord, High Hegemon, CEO, spacer. Every prophet, every thief, every friend." 
He looks at you with suddenly-piercing eyes, "Even you star-farer, fleet-captain. Death will come."

You stay a while in the ossuary of Killa.
The hollow eyes keep silent vigil. Stacks and wings and arches and forests of human bone adorn every surface.
The dust-flux pulses slowly, like the breath of a titanic creature.

Veils of dust slowly flex and twist in the electrostatic fields of the shrine, strong enough to overcome the low gravity of this world to hang in the near-vacuum.
Instructions are given by some unnamed Luddic priest who recites their words into crude repeaters awoken by your activity:
"Come only in peace. Let rest the dead. We pray now in the words revealed to Ludd... "

The concourse is in chaos. A crowd of protestors in Luddic greens has formed a human barrier across the main entrance. Surrounding them are angry spacers, officers and crew alike, waiting to enter the commercial promenade or return to their ships.

[Line 1494] You recognize the Hegemony $post, $name speaking orders into a small comms unit. $HeOrShe notices you, and nods you over.
"Luddics protesting the planet-side burns," $heOrShe explains. "Get these every other week due to the pilgrims. They consider it a sort of rite of passage." 
$HeOrShe one-arm shrugs to suggest that $heOrShe doesn't find the matter worth getting too upset over, then speaks another string of tactical jargon into $hisOrHer comms.

[Line 1502] [Option Selected: Wait for the authorities to clear the protest]
You wait. The crowd grows, and grows less patient - a minority jeers and shouts, a few spacers start throwing trash. The Luddics perform their chant-prayer, calling for an end to the orbital burns, arms locked. From fights breaking out, it is clear that there is much support for the Luddic cause outside of the overt protestors.
It feels near a boiling point when heads start to turn and you see a dark regiment of lightly armored troopers deploy from columns into a wedge. Security drones hum overhead, targeting lasers and ID-cams flickering.

[Line 1502] [Options Given: lpp_jangalaProtestWait2:Wait]

[Line 1503] [Option Selected: Wait]
A steady advance breaks the protest line apart, shock-prods rise and fall to silence shouts and screams. It is difficult to see through the pacification gas, but you can make out drones deploying restraint foam on struggling forms. The Luddics' fists, signs, and even hammers are useless against the power-armored gendarmerie.
"You may pass safely, citizen," a drone buzzes at you in a pleasant voice.
Stepping toward the main promenade, you turn to find that you've left a diminishing trail of blood-spots. A scuff or two of your heel on the deck plate takes care of the problem.

The $faction $rank shakes $hisOrHer head. "Appreciate the patriotic gesture, citizen, but we'll handle this. Got to be delicate," $heOrShe says with annoyance, "It's very... political."

[Line 1505] [Option Selected: Offer your marines to help clear the protest]
Suddenly the $rank does a double-take. "$playerName? That's you, isn't it? Commissioned Auxiliary, right? Had an alert come through when you entered orbit."

[Line 1506] [Option Selected: Offer your marines to help clear the protest]
$HeOrShe seems to think it over for a second, then glances at a small datapad. 
"Tell you what; get your marines here in three minutes and subsume to my command, here's the comm-code. I want min-force, zero fire and flash; weapons locked to my authorization."

lpp_jangalaProtestMarinesHelpNo:"On second thought, I'll let you handle this."]

[Line 1507] [Option Selected: "Agreed. I'll give the order."]
You coordinate a joint response, a squad of your marines able to quickly deploy on the dock-side and coordinate with the Hegemony gendarmerie on the opposite end of the protest. A steady advance breaks the protest line apart with minimal use of force - the Luddics fists, hammers, and signs useless against power-armored troops.
$Rank $personName is busy coordinating arrests in the aftermath but manages to catch your eye and give a quick half-salute as you leave toward the commercial promenade.

[Line 1507] [Options Given: lpp_jangalaProtestEndGeneric:Continue]

[Line 1508] [Option Selected: "On second thought, I'll let you handle this."]
The $rank nods, distractedly. "As you will, captain."

[Line 1509] [Option Selected: "Pilgrims? Is there some kind of shrine here?"]
"Not here," $heOrShe says, eyes not leaving the protestors. "On the surface. For appreciating the local plant-life. Don't understand why, you wouldn't believe how toxic the stuff is. Detox after exposure is like a week of hangover compressed down into a day or two."
$HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head. "At least that's what it felt like for me. Guess they like suffering. Luddics for you. Top brass says we gotta humor 'em. Politics, right?"
A burst of coded garble comes through the comms, and the $post gives a short response. "Gendarmerie will be here soon if you want to stay for the show," $heOrShe says.

[Line 1510] Suddenly the $rank does a double-take. "$playerName? That's you, isn't it? Commissioned Auxiliary, right? Had an alert come through when you entered orbit."

[Line 1512] [Option Selected: Use your commission with the Hegemony to pass]
"Look, sorry about all of this," $heOrShe indicates the protest. "Tell you what- I can route you and your crew through secure access so you don't have to wait on the circus."

[Line 1515] [Option Selected: Accept]
The $rank waves a cadet over, giving them instructions to lead you, your guards, and a few of your crew given shore leave - who are looking increasingly impatient - through an alternate route to the commercial promenade.

[Line 1515] [Options Given: lpp_jangalaProtestEndGeneric:Continue]

[Line 1516] [Option Selected: Use your standing with the Church to pass]
You calmly approach the Luddic protestors, asking to speak to an organizer. They are reluctant to identify a leader who would make an obvious target for MuniSec guards, but soon enough you are recognized by one of the better-dressed Luddics. It appears that your reputation precedes you.
They enthusiastically vouch for you, "a true friend of the Church", and manage to persuade the protestors to clear a path for you and your landing party.
As you step into the commercial promenade, past merchants and spacers annoyed at your special treatment, you begin to hear amplified orders to disperse from the Hegemony gendarmerie.

[Line 1516] [Options Given: lpp_jangalaProtestEndGeneric:Continue]

[Line 1517] [Option Selected: Join the protestors, help them take a stand]
You step forward, proclaiming that you wish to join the protest. At first the Luddics are disbelieving, but as you turn to face the bewildered MuniSec guards and take up the Luddic chant-prayer, a small cheer erupts.
You see $PersonRank $personLastName shake $hisOrHer head in disbelief.

Later, you compare bruises and cuts with your fellow protestors.

The pilgrims welcome you as a respectable outsider, pledging hospitality if you visit their homesteads and congregations.

Most of the protestors are alarmed by your rhetoric, glancing nervously toward unseen observation devices and drawing away from your corner of the holding cell. Though a couple younger pilgrims and one much older, with scars to show his commitment, remain near you, eyes daring the others to speak their criticism aloud.
"We hear you, $playerBrotherOrSister. The end of the Path is near," he whispers, and tells you of the Jangala Shrine, of mortification of the flesh through exposure to the xenolife - worse than anything MuniSec could hope to inflict.
Your name is called from the commsplate.

[Line 1522] [Option Selected: You just wanted to feel what it was like to lose a fight]
The Luddic protestors are confused and even a little alarmed by your explanation - it seems they've been locked in with a crazy person. They physically draw away from your corner of the holding cell until your name is called through the commsplate.

[Line 1524] It's $rank $personName again, $hisOrHer demeanor cold and martial.
"The rules are simple, captain," $heOrShe says, ice-cold, "And we've been very, very lenient with you. But there seems to be a failure to communicate, so let me explain in very small words how it works around here."
A guard sets a plastic tray of your personal belongings on the battered table of the processing room. The Hegemony $rank continues, slowly; each word given emphasis. "Pay your tariffs. Don't disrupt business."
$HeOrShe turns and motions at some guards, "Now get out of my sight."

You are shoved, squinting, into the bright light of the plaza outside of the municipal security processing center.

[Line 1526] [Option Selected: Use your marines to muscle through right now]
You order a small squad of your own marines, armaments and munitions removed due to port regulations, on a fast shuttle from your $shipOrFleet.

The protestors' line is easily broken by your armored marines, as are not a few limbs. The MuniSec guards manage to exploit the situation and coral the protestors - now crying, screaming, and shouting abuse at you in particular - into ineffective huddles.
The Hegemony officer overseeing the official response looks not simply annoyed, but livid.

[Line 1538] [Option Selected: Take a shuttle to visit the Luddic shrine]
Your shuttle descends toward verdant continents crowned by lethargically churning storm systems. The orbital burn lasers flicker from the spark of Jangala station, invisible until they cut lines of plasma through the atmosphere.
You pass through blinding cloud cover, the light taking on a sickly hue of green. Your viewport is streaked with marching droplets of spore-laden water as the shuttle slows to drop softly onto the landing pad nearly lost in the overgrowth of Jangalan foliage.

[Line 1538] [Options Given: lpp_JangalaEnter1:Enter the shrine complex]

[Line 1539] [Option Selected: Take a shuttle to visit the Luddic shrine]
The verdant continents of Jangala sprawl beneath you, crowned by huge weather systems churning lethargic and magisterial. 
Searing lines of orbital burn lasers flick out from Jangala station, invisible until they cut slashes of plasma through the thick atmosphere. Burn-glow competes with rampaging electrical storms to illuminate the mountainous cloud formations from below.

[Line 1540] [Option Selected: Continue]
The hum of your shuttle changes pitch as it hits the edge of true atmosphere, passing quickly into cloud cover. Beyond the viewpanes human-eye visibility is reduced to nearly zero. As the shuttle fires retros for landing, dipping well below the speed of sound by the demand of both nav regs and good manners, your viewport begins to collect marching droplets of moisture.  
The droplets have an odd ochre coloration, and the clouds above a sickly green tinge. You've heard of this effect; fine-grained spore-analogs in the atmosphere.

A quick datapad search reveals that, statistically, human activity within the Jangalan biosphere is relatively safe so long as proper air filtration and decontamination procedures are followed. Detox meds for accidental exposures are readily available, though may have unpleasant side effects.
There are reports of individuals whose poor luck and lack of contingency planning combined with vehicle malfunction during truly abysmal weather has resulted in cases of long term exposure to Jangalas biosphere for days, weeks, and in one case more than a standard month. The resulting growths and infections appear to result in a singularly tortuous manner of death.

Your shuttle descends to the landing pad, the Jangalan foliage encroaching through its own ashes to reclaim the space.
You pop a standard dose of antixenols and re-examine the quality of your breathing mask as the access tunnel takes a moment to perform a self-cleaning cycle on exposed surfaces. The air feels no different, yet.
Maybe a little warmer, a little heavier with moisture.

[Line 1544] [Option Selected: Enter the shrine complex]
The reception lounge is filled with parties of Luddic pilgrims in traditional handweave led by subcurates in ritual hand-washing. A glance upward reveals the true cleansing: a battery of air-purification units caught in a tangle of murmuring ducts.
Foliage presses itself almost sensually against the outer viewports, letting in only dim light. The plant life seems to twitch, liquids oozing over the panes from cracks in bladders and tubules, leaving rivulets cutting across flaking encrustations. Between the zeal of the foliage and hand-crafted charm of Luddic engineering, the place feels distinctly worrisome compared to the environmental containment you are accustomed to.

One of the shrine's attendants scurries to meet you.
"The complex is kept overpressurized," they say, following your gaze, "so if there were a breach, there would be plenty of time to find and seal the leak."
The attendant creates what must be intended to be a reassuring smile. "How might we assist you?"

[Line 1551] [Option Selected: "This seems like a... difficult place to maintain a shrine."]
"Bringing oneself before the sacred is not a matter of convenience," the attendant says serenely. "That we must travail so to worship here confers upon the act an extraordinary sense of self-reflection, I believe."

[Line 1551] [Options Given: lpp_jangalaattendantFoolish:"That seems foolish."
lpp_jangalaattendantUnprotected:"I hear some pilgrims go outside unprotected."
lpp_jangalaattendantVisit:"I would like to visit the shrine."]

"Perhaps." The attendant cools a little, "As Ludd said, 'To hold faith in your heart, wholly and truly, invites small cruelties of the tongue's lash.'"
"And do you know what Ludd said next?," they ask, rhetorically, "'Let faith be your armor; let walls of devotion build you a citadel, and there we shall be always in spiritual union.'"
The attendant seems satisfied with the unassailability of this statement, and wishing to hurry you along before things get more awkward, adds "Is there anything else I may assist you with?"

lpp_jangalaShrineLeaveNoHook:Leave]

The attendant looks you over skeptically. 
"You are sure of this? You desire this with full knowledge of what exposure to Jangala entails?" 
The attendant brings your attention to a row of pamphlets in a tasteful wooden stand displaying what, at a glance, appear to be a selection of truly unholy skin conditions.

[Line 1557] [Option Selected: "I am no sightseer. I wish to test my faith."]
The attendant looks at you with new respect.

"Would it not be 'foolish', captain, to expose yourself to the outside?" the attendant says, somehow keeping peevishness out of their tone if not words.
As if on cue - or perhaps because they were hovering nearby the whole time - a curate (you presume) of the shrine steps up to you and the attendant, robes not quite resplendent but conveying a sense of care and craft that belies a higher status in the Church.

You are led past heavy curtains. The murmur of pilgrims is muted, and all artificial light shut out.
Your eyes adjust to the shrine-chamber, taking in rows of silhouetted pilgrims kneeling before polished panes of diamond-matrix, illuminated by the sickly yellow-green cloud cover from without. 
Beyond the windows, you see overgrown human figures - a statue garden. The forms blister with growths, crawling with tendrils, sprouting the fruiting bodies of alien life. One moves; not the wind, but another pilgrim, exposed and outdoors. There are people out there, you realize with a start, wearing only light robes. Easily overtaken by the overgrowth.

At their feet, more forms come into focus; covered by a quilt of mosses and mycelium, or whatever alien equivalent, which obscures the feet of the statues. Bones. Or are they fallen branches and overgrown rocks? The final wish for some terminally-devoted fanatics, or your imagination set loose?
The green churns not quite imperceptibly in the course of the minutes you watch, all-consuming, ferociously regenerative, a cycle of life that could be born of Earth or an alien world.

You are led past heavy curtains which mute the murmur of pilgrims and shut out all artificial light. Pilgrims kneel in the shrine-chamber, silhouetted before the glowing panes to without lit by that sickly yellow-green cloud cover.
Beyond, you see the statue garden. The forms blister with growths, crawling with tendrils, sprouting fruiting bodies of xenolife. Among them are pilgrims, exposed in only light robes. Easily overtaken by the overgrowth. At their feet, covered by a quilt of mosses and mycelium or alien equivalents, are bones. Or are they fallen branches, overgrown rocks? The final wish for terminally-devoted fanatics, or your imagination?
The green churns not quite imperceptibly in the course of the minutes you watch, all-consuming, ferociously regenerative, a cycle of life that could be born of Earth or an alien world.

[Line 1564] [Option Selected: "Yes. I wish to go outside."]
The air hits you in the environmental lock, warm and wet, like high-G shock foam. You step out alone, for this is how it is done.
Oozing nets hang from the shrine complex; rhizomes sprouting luridly colored bulbs that glow in what passes for sunlight. Dust, or tiny bugs, or spores float about, moving in swirls against the heavy and languid air.

[Line 1565] [Option Selected: Take off your mask. Have faith.]
You reach up and loose your mask, drawing in breath from Jangala. Shallowly at first, then deeper. The smells of spice and rot and ammonia and fresh greens. Whatever may come, you know it won't instantly kill you, and anything that happens is reversible. Is that a tingle, a catch in your throat?
Have faith.
You follow the short trail you were told of. It seems nearly overgrown, feelers and tendrils brush against you.
There are others. Maskless pilgrims, tears streaming from their red eyes and mucus from their noses, skin blotchy, white robes rapidly discolored by alien emissions. They meet your eyes, smile and nod in camaraderie, making the signs of Ludd for you.

[Line 1565] [Options Given: lpp_jangalaOutsideMaskOff1:Join them]

[Line 1566] [Option Selected: Join them]
There are overgrown human figures - a statue garden. The forms blister with growths, crawling with tendrils, sprouting the fruiting bodies of alien life.
One moves; not the wind, but another pilgrim, the growths taking hold. How long does this take, hours? Days?
It becomes distracting, hard to focus. You feel like you might die, but the feeling reaches a plateau, a sea of pain and irritation. You allow yourself to float in a buzzing atonal headache, itchiness, torment.
And something more.

"Blessed for the day, Captain," they just manage to hide the quaver in their voice. "With apologies, your request to land has been denied." 
As you draw breath to reply, the initiate's eyes flick to a notification and go wide.
"Apologies, Captain ... I mean, respectfully. I... the Excubitor Orbis wishes to speak with you," they say without stumbling on the title. Practice, you're sure.
"Transferring link."

The Excubitor Orbis appears before you.
"Captain $playerName," he says by way of greeting, a stern gaze already fixed on you.
The moment draws longer. He is the image of poise, perfectly content to wait for you to speak. A wrinkle appears, then disappears, by a mouth which appears fixed permanently on the precipice of a frown.

The silence extends, uncomfortably. He blinks, slowly.
He's really doing this. Some kind of test, or challenge. Are you going to let him win?
He isn't giving up. He continues to stare, absurdly, saying nothing. You notice the subtlest flicker in the image as the display corrects for signal fluctuation.

[Line 1601] [Option Selected: Keep strong. Keep silent.]
The hum of your ship grows in your ears, the sense of inhabiting your own body in a can hurtling around a gravity well, the incomprehensible webs of influence keeping you both in this place and in the constant dynamism of crisis.
Lower and higher dimensions twist and vibrate, a web conspiring to hold you up - or back - falling and clinging just so. Your technologies tap these invisible quirks of physics to keep you warm, to keep your feet on the ground, to keep the air flowing follow a rhythm, a meter. It is like music, in fact. If you listen carefully...
It would be impossible to speak, now.

[Line 1601] [Options Given: lpp_hesperusExcubitorWait3:Listen carefully... ]

[Line 1602] [Option Selected: Listen carefully...]
You almost jump as the Excubitor Orbis speaks, pulling you back to the moment.
"You possess patience," he says. A new wrinkle appears beside his mouth; what passes for a smile among the Knights of Ludd, you suppose.
"I did not expect it of you."
You've won. Is this victory? It is an uncomfortable feeling.

"At present I am more concerned with your spirit."

The landing bay antechamber is a baroque gothic-militant display of post-industrial salvage. Dead suits of power armor stand at attention, weapons proudly displayed.

The gallery is filled with parties of Luddic pilgrims dressed in traditional handweave meeting with shrine attendants.

At your request, the attending subcurate leads you through a brief ceremonial hand-washing, then down a long gallery.
The flow of the curate's robe doesn't quite touch the floor, a welded field of armored plates weathered into intricate patterns by the varied atmospheres of a score of worlds on which the Knights have fought and died. Niches along the walls are occupied by empty helmets.

The shrine is a grand tomb set in an enormous airshaft. The industrial viscera has been transformed into a baroque sculpture of thousands of edged weapons aligned like feathers of a wing, rays of gleaming serrated metal boldly thrust in killing arcs through the vast space.
In the center, surrounded by a galaxy of flickering candles, lie the lead-lined caskets of a squad of martyred Knights. The manner of their deaths, the subcurate explains in reverent whispers, left their bodies unidentifiable and infused with radioactive material which would kill a direct observer even to this day.
You are left in a prayer-niche to contemplate the horror.

Your introspection seems to throw the initiate off. You can see the thought work across his face- are you making fun of me? But it is quickly dismissed, and you are filed under 'not a threat'.

[Line 1664] [Option Selected: "Despite appearances, I am a pilgrim, young knight."]
"Right," he sticks his chest out a little more, categorizing you safely within his teleology. "I'm sworn to protect your lot, you know."

[Line 1665] [Option Selected: "I am here only to see what is to be seen."]
He takes a moment to parse your response. You can see it work across his face- are you making fun of me? But the thought is dismissed, and you are filed under 'not a threat'.

[Line 1666] [Option Selected: "So quick to start a fight? You've only just signed up."]
"I'm a knight, sworn and-" he catches himself raising his voice, looks nervously to check for shrine attendants, "-and a member of the order. I'll die in service of my sacred duty."
He nods brusquely at the trio of lead-lined coffins at the center of the shrine. "Like they did, if I have to. I'm not scared."

[Line 1667] [Option Selected: Nod and make an appropriately serious face]
He seems satisfied, just, with your apparent acceptance of his declaration. Out of the corner of your eye you see him turn back toward the center of the shrine, sigh, and resume what you assume to be an initiation-vigil.
Time will have to test him and tell if he will actually be any good as a Knight of Ludd.

[Line 1667] [Options Given: lpp_hesperusShrineWrapUp:Continue]

[Line 1668] [Option Selected: "I can tell."]
You see his jaw clench, and quick anger rise in his posture. You wonder briefly at how the shrine attendants would react to a Knight-initiate assaulting a visitor, but out of the corner of your eye you can see the young man steady himself, then turn and lock his gaze toward the center of the shrine, maintaining control and mumbling prayer.
He may actually have what it takes to become a good Knight of Ludd one day.

[Line 1668] [Options Given: lpp_hesperusShrineWrapUp:Continue]

[Line 1669] [Option Selected: "You should be. That death is hell I would not wish upon my worst enemy."]
Your grim delivery sinks the thought into the young man. You can see it in his eyes, and his pale scalp; yes, fear.
In that fear, he seems to forget trying to get a rise out of you and locks his gaze toward the center of the shrine, mumbling a prayer.
He might actually have what it takes to become a good Knight of Ludd one day.

[Line 1669] [Options Given: lpp_hesperusShrineWrapUp:Continue]

[Line 1670] [Option Selected: "I seek a Path not so different from yours."]
The thought disrupts his expectations, and you can see it in his sudden squint. He looks around, making sure no subcurate is watching, then leans closer.
"What like ...the Path?" he whispers in horrified fascination, "Do you know Brother Cotton?"

[Line 1671] [Options Given: lpp_hesperusInitiateCottonMaybe:"I've met him. His views are... unique."
lpp_hesperusInitiateMetCottonYes:"I've met him. Brother Cotton is a true visionary."

lpp_hesperusInitiateNotMetCottonNo:"No. I have my own Path to follow."]

[Line 1673] [Option Selected: "No. But I'd like to."]
The initiate's eyes are wide; he's clearly impressed. "Don't tell anyone, but... I mean, you have to admit what Cotton has done is cunning and brave. The... the Creator gave him gifts, and he uses them."

[Line 1674] [Option Selected: "I've met him. Brother Cotton is a true visionary."]
The initiate's eyes are wide; he's clearly impressed. "Don't tell anyone, but... I would like to meet him too. Maybe join him." 
He glances guiltily toward the shrine-attendants. "Maybe."

[Line 1675] [Option Selected: "No. But I'd like to. Then do what must be done."]
The initiate's eyes are wide; he's clearly impressed. "Don't tell anyone, but... I would like to meet him. Hear what he had to say. Maybe join up."

[Line 1676] [Option Selected: "Yes. He's a snake that puts on a polite mask to charm people."]
The initiate's eyes are wide; he's clearly impressed. And troubled. 
"But... the things he does, I mean," the young man visibly struggles between what he feels and what he has been told. "Maybe he goes too far, but at least he tries, you know?"

[Line 1677] [Option Selected: "No. I have my own Path to follow."]
The initiate nods in response, but is unsure now of your outlook.
"I mean, say what you will about Cotton," he glances guiltily toward the shrine attendants, "He fights for what he believes. At least."

A troubled look passes over his face. "The Knights, sometimes it seems like they are more interested in making rules for the sake of rules instead of fighting evil."
With a sigh, the initiate returns his gaze toward the radioactive martyrs.

[Line 1679] He nods brusquely, then returns his gaze to the lead coffins. "I'm supposed to contemplate their sacrifice. Horrible way to die, like that. You're a," he glances at your garb again, "spacer, right? Ever seen that happen to anyone?"

The shrine is a grand tomb set in an enormous airshaft. The industrial viscera has been transformed into a baroque sculpture of thousands of edged weapons aligned like feathers of a wing, rays of gleaming serrated metal boldly thrust in killing arcs through the vast space.
In the middle, surrounded by a galaxy of flickering candles, lie the lead-lined caskets of a squad of martyred Knights. The manner of their deaths, the subcurate explains in reverent whispers, left their bodies unidentifiable and infused with radioactive material which would kill a direct observer even to this day.

The Archcurate stops what she's doing, holds her hands together, and looks roughly toward the comm-feed.
"Yes?"

[Line 1699] [Options Given: lke_jaspisInfoReply1:"You mentioned payment for the job."]

[Line 1704] [Option Selected: "What if I can't find him? What if he is dead?"]
This gives the Archcurate pause. 
"I pray that you will find him, and I have faith that Providence will provide your path. If you are thwarted, then I shall accept the records of your investigation in exchange for just compensation."
"And... if the worst came to pass, I would have his body receive a proper burial among the Knights." The old woman deflates a little, you can see, at the thought.

[Line 1705] [Option Selected: "This could be dangerous. I need more details."]
She considers her words as she sips something - tea, you suppose.
"He went amongst the wrathful and ill-led heretics of the so-called Luddic Path. If my understanding of your accomplishments is correct, then you have a full and fair idea of what you may face."
"Battle. In the void and upon the earth, entered through iniquitous trickery." She nods to herself, "That is how they fight. I would not ask you to walk amongst them if I did not think you were capable of matching their wickedness."

[Line 1707] [Option Selected: "I've given your proposal some thought. I will find your missing agent."]
She closes her eyes and bows her head, hands held together. You would swear she is saying a quiet prayer.
Her blind eyes open, and she looks at you across the comm-link.
"His name is Jethro Bornanew," she says.

[Line 1707] [Options Given: lke_jaspisStart2:Continue]

[Line 1708] [Option Selected: Continue]
"He is a late-initiated Novice of the Luddic Knights. My assistant will provide you with an identity file."

"Chalcedon, in the Kumari Kandam system. He was to join some inner circle of the Path; he was to meet with a leader, or some manner of recruiter. Nothing have I heard since."
For a moment the Archcurate looks upward, and her lips move soundlessly, before she returns to face you.

[Line 1718] [Options Given: lke_jaspisStartCotton:"Is this about Brother Cotton?"]

[Line 1719] [Option Selected: "Can you tell me more about his mission?"]
"Mm," she thinks for a moment before proceeding. "He was to pose as a man broken and lost, looking for a cause to illuminate his path. This would require little play-acting on Jethro's part." 
"He would join a particular branch of the Luddic Path and prove himself by his aptitude and charm to make association with centermost leaders. He would send information to us, receive orders in return, and perform certain acts to influence the heretics' decisions."

[Line 1719] [Options Given: lke_jaspisStartHisMission1:"He is acting as your spy."
lke_jaspisStartHisMission2:"Is it possible he turned on you?"]

[Line 1720] [Option Selected: "He is acting as your spy."]
"Yes," the Archcurate says. "He is a good man, and so driven, who would take on this heavy burden to ease suffering and combat wrathful heresy."

[Line 1721] [Option Selected: "Is it possible he turned on you?"]
"No," the Archcurate says without hesitation. "He is a good man, and so driven."

"I mustn't and I shan't," she says fiercely. "And that will be the end of it."

[Line 1723] [Option Selected: "Then he may be... in trouble."]
"That he may," she says softly.

[Line 1725] [Option Selected: "Can you tell me more about Bornanew?"]
"His is a gentle soul, though rough-treated. He was in the House of Penitents when his case was brought before me, some years ago." The Archcurate turns slightly, as if taking in a vision from memory. "Prison, you would call it."
"It is my duty, more than simply charity, to review petitions of absolution as my schedule permits. I found in Jethro a bright mind, contrite and eager to learn anew. His crimes were not so great, and his part due more to his desire to please his associates than some inborn malice. I made his repentance my cause for a time, and by its end, he took on a new name, and he asked... how could he serve."


[Line 1725] [Options Given: lke_jaspisStartBornanew2:Continue]

[Line 1726] [Option Selected: Continue]
"There was need for someone of his... experience. I sent him to train with the Knights, whereupon he became an initiate, and upon achieving the rank of novice he was assigned back to my Office of Archcuratorship to earn his knighthood through the service I required of him."
"I confess," she says quietly, "I fear that I have again spent the life of a good man. It is my pride-," Jaspis gives a bitter little laugh. "Perhaps it truly blinds me."

"No. But the specter of his death weighs upon me as if it were already so."
She sighs. "I am old, captain, and perhaps I have borne this office too long. Let us speak of finding Bornanew, not of my guilt."

[Line 1728] [Option Selected: "... Again?"]
"Yes." She sighs, "I am old, captain, and perhaps I have borne this office too long. Let us speak of Bornanew now, not of my guilt."

[Line 1729] [Option Selected: "You sound... a little bloodthirsty when it comes to the Path."]
Her expression tightens, multiplying the wrinkles on her face. "This I cannot deny."
"These heretics have vexed me for more years than you've lived; they have read Ludd's words through a glass, darkly, and they have seen a fearful vision. A dear and now departed fellow-walker said that it is a vision I have too-long contemplated."
She raises her hands, palms upward, "God shall weigh my soul," one hand drops. "I shall accept that judgment."

[Line 1730] [Option Selected: "Is this about Brother Cotton?"]
You would swear that she gives you a hard look with her blind eyes.
"I cannot answer wholly yes or no," she says. "At one point, it might have been. Now I am not so sure."

You explain that while you were indeed at the protest on Jangala Station on that fated day, it is not all as it appears. 
The holos that leaked out were manipulated by secret Hegemony AI cores which substituted your face for that of a Hegemony officer on the scene. The cowards are trying to deflect blame away from themselves! It is obvious that the long-term goal of the Hegemony is to stamp out all spiritual belief, the better to assert AI-led control over the population and turn all humans into mere machines, cogs in a new Domain; a mechanistic galaxy-straddling Moloch built in defiance of God's creation!

It was the subsequent black propaganda/cover-up that placed you at the center of the action.
Kanta is, of course, a hollowed-out shell controlled by an AI core; an abomination in the eyes of all followers of Ludd but indeed the very image of the Hegemony's ultimate goal for all humanity in the Persean Sector: machine-slaves to false AI-gods tasked with building a new Domain; a mechanistic galaxy-straddling Moloch to defy the very nature of God's creation!

[Line 1773] "Blessed is our way," $heOrShe says, "on this Path together, $playerBrotherOrSister."
The $personPost smiles, "Yes, we have heard of you. Good things; godly things."

[Line 1773] [Options Given: lke_ephiphanyVIPreasonStart:Continue]

[Line 1774] "Blessed peace upon you," $heOrShe begins with a tone of skepticism. "I cannot but wonder what brings one who walks with the Church among us who are so far from Gilead." $HeOrShe makes a quick reassuring smile, "I seek no fight, mind; you are spoken well of... by some."

[Line 1774] [Options Given: lke_ephiphanyVIPreasonStart:Continue]

[Line 1776] "You joined the faithful in resisting, albeit symbolically, the Hegemony oppressors who desecrate the holy world of Jangala. It is a small thing, and surely inadequate, but," $heOrShe smiles, "Your first step on the Path won't stomp our enemies out all at once."

[Line 1777] "I am told that Brother Cotton would like you to be told of his kind regards." $HeOrShe lifts an eyebrow, "I shan't ask why, though it does make one curious."

[Line 1778] "And a young Knight Initiate - former Initiate, I should say - spoke well of your simple words on Hesperus which set him on a new Path."

[Line 1779] "It is said that you walk with us. Perhaps not quite on the same Path, but close enough that we might pray together with truth in our hearts."

"Are you looking to join the Luddic Path? It may be easier than you think." 
$HeOrShe gives an annoyed look, "So I hear, I mean. This isn't the place to have such a discussion. There's a spacer bar on the surface, I'll give you the address. Go there. Someone there will be able to... help you."
$HeOrShe smiles, "I pray that your Path will be filled with righteous glory, captain."

[Line 1788] [Option Selected: "Look, he had to talk to someone, right? A recruiter?"]
$HeOrShe gives a half-hearted chuckle. "How am I to answer that? If I give you a name, am I signing a death-warrant? Will the Knights of Ludd come through their door to seize another 'heretic' for the noose?"

[Line 1789] [Option Selected: "I simply want to talk."]
"Then talk!" $heOrShe says, annoyed. "But not to me. I have work to do, and you've distracted me enough."
$HeOrShe turns away, and gives you a perfunctory "Blessed day."
The link cuts from the other end.

[Line 1791] [Option Selected: "I promise, I mean no ill-will. You have friends in the Church."]
"Yes," $heOrShe nods along to your words. "It is true that many in the Church long for a truer expression of Ludd's teachings unhindered by that corrupt bureaucracy. You wouldn't believe-"
$PersonName catches $himOrHerself and gives a little cough. "Regardless, this is not the place for such talk. There's a spacer bar on the surface, I'll give you the address. Go there. Someone there will be able to... help you."

[Line 1794] "Blessed is the day," $personName says, looking at you skeptically. "What brings you to our humble world?"
OR
"Peace of Ludd upon you," $personName says, somewhat hastily. "Why has Providence set our humble world on your Path?"
OR
"Blessings of Ludd," $personName says, examining you. "Pray tell what brings you and your $shipOrFleet to Chalcedon?"
OR
"May Providence favor this day and peace see its end," $personName says, looking you over. "What path brings you to our stormy home, captain?"
OR
"We thank Providence for this day and its peace," says $personName, holding $hisOrHer hands together piously. "How may I be of help, captain?"

[Line 1795] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for someone who may have joined the Path."]
"Ah." $HeOrShe keeps looking at you.
"If I am understanding your intention, that might not be so easy. The Path is joined with the heart, the immortal spirit, not some number or identification file."
OR
"Someone?" $HeOrShe smiles in not wholly sincere apology.
"There are many people who come to Chalcedon, some who stay, some who go. Some who find that for which they search, and many who do not."

[Line 1796] [Option Selected: "Look, he had to talk to someone, right? A recruiter?"]
"You may not like this, but I speak truly: the best recruiter for the Path is the Hegemony's brutality toward the Faithful, the Tri-Tachyon mercenary-assassins who cut down our children, the ravages of the Domain you can see all around us."
OR
"The brutal suppression of our Faith recruits for the Path, captain. Those who ravage Creation and build false idols to assault God's domain - it is they recruit for the Path."

[Line 1796] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonLookingRecD2:"You know what I mean. I'm looking for a person. A recruiter."
lke_chalcedonLookingRecD2b:"I understand, but I'm looking for someone to talk to."

[Line 1798] [Option Selected: "You know what I mean. I'm looking for a person. A recruiter.";['lke_chalcedonLookingRecD2b']]
The very ghost of a frown appears on $hisOrHer face.
"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, captain. And if I did..." $heOrShe shrugs, almost, but not quite apologetic.
OR
"Surely I wouldn't know anything about that," $heOrShe says quickly.
A new furrow appears in $hisOrHer brow, and $heOrShe adds, more quietly, "Such an association could be... dangerous."

[Line 1798] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonLookingRecOutB:"It is not my intention to cause you trouble, I'm simply looking for a man."
lke_chalcedonLookingRecOutA:"Perhaps a donation would help jog your memory?"
]

[Line 1799] [Option Selected: "Are you being intentionally dense? Just give me a straight answer."]
$PersonName folds $hisOrHer hands, a tense smile appearing on $hisOrHer face.
"What do you think of us, really. Ignorant fanatics, fearful of machines, fleeing before your might? Your arrogance astounds me."
The $personPost taps something on a control console.
OR
"You may not see it, but I am trying to help you."
Something tenses in $hisOrHer expression. "If your eyes were not shut to Ludd's light, you might understand. But the false flame of pride, of power, leads you astray."
The $personPost taps something on a control console.

[Line 1800] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Captain," the voice of your comms officer quietly speaks in your ear, "They've sent some kind of coded signal. Nearby Pather fleets will be alerted to our position."
You acknowledge the report and turn your attention back to the Pather on the comms link - and find that the connection has been terminated.

[Line 1800] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonLookingRecMad2:Cut the comms]

[Line 1802] [Option Selected: "Perhaps a donation would help jog your memory?"]
$HisOrHer expression hardens noticeably. "I'm very sorry, captain, but all the credits in the Sector won't save my soul."
$HeOrShe turns away, giving you a perfunctory "Blessed day," before cutting the comm-link.
OR
A deep frown grows on $hisOrHer face. "I am not to be bought and sold like a cache of supplies, captain."
$HeOrShe turns to cut the comms, added a "Ludd save you," before hitting the termination command.

[Line 1803] [Option Selected: "It is not my intention to cause you trouble, I'm simply looking for a man."]
"I'm very sorry, captain, but I have much work to do."
$HeOrShe turns away, giving you a perfunctory "Blessed day."
The link cuts from the other end.

[Line 1806] "I'm afraid that I know no one by that name, captain." $HeOrShe shrugs apologetically.
"If you are looking for a member of the Path, that will not be easy. It is, as I'm sure you know, a kinship of people, not numbers and indices. You must know someone who trusts you and knows the one for whom you look."
"So forgive me, but I do not have your answer. But... " $heOrShe smiles coyly, "I may know who to ask."
OR
"I know not that name, $playerSirOrMadam," $heOrShe says. "We do not believe in indexing people with the beast's number. To find someone, you must know someone, and you must build a bridge of trust. This is the Luddic way."
"So," $heOrShe nods, conceding something, "while I have no answer for you, I may know someone who does."

[Line 1807] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonLookingBornanewA3:"Who should I ask?"]

[Line 1808] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonLookingBornanewA3:"Who should I ask?"
lke_chalcedonLookingBornanewA3b:"... Is it Brother Cotton?"]

[Line 1809] [Option Selected: "... Is it Brother Cotton?"]
"It is not. Please," $heOrShe says nervously, "Be mindful of mentioning our brother so freely."

[Line 1809] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonLookingBornanewA3:"So who should I ask?"]

[Line 1810] [Option Selected: "So who should I ask?"]
"He will approach you at a spacer bar on the surface, if you are alone. I shall give you the address. He will be able to... help you."
"I pray that your Path will be filled with righteous glory, captain."

[Line 1810] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 1811] [Option Selected: "I'm searching for Jethro Bornanew."]
The very ghost of a frown appears on $hisOrHer face.
"I'm afraid that I know no one by that name, captain. And if I did..." $heOrShe shrugs, almost but not quite apologetic.
It is clear that one should not simply ask about a potential member of the Path and expect to receive a straight answer.

[Line 1812] [Option Selected: "I'm searching for Jethro Bornanew."]

LKE Chalcedon ask around bar
------------------------------
[Line 1819] You have a meeting scheduled with a Mammonite to talk with a third party who might know something about Jethro Bornanew, but it is not yet the agreed upon time.

[Line 1820] A simple, steaming cup of tea is placed before you with a subtle hint from the proprietor that you need but ask and something much stronger will arrive in a teapot.
Before you can make a proper assessment of the colorful figures who tend to populate this sort of establishment, a man sits next to you with casual self-assurance, takes your tea, and downs the entire cup in one go.

[Line 1820] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonBarSedge1:Continue
lke_chalcedonBarSedge1b:"Hey, that was my tea!"]

[Line 1822] You take your time, drinking tea and asking around, eventually finding yourself at a table with a 'Mammon's man'; a free agent who interfaces between Pathers and the outside world while despised by both.
Well aware that he will sell any useful information you let slip to Pathers or Pather-hunters, you say...

[Line 1827] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for someone who may have joined the Path."]
The Mammonite chuckles darkly, shaking his head. "Captain $playerFirstName. This is Chalcedon; everyone maybe has joined the Path. You must be more specific, much more."
At your hesitation, he continues, "You must trust me, just a little, yes? If you don't tell me what you need, then I cannot provide."

[Line 1828] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for someone who recruits for the Path."]
"Looking for." He raises his eyebrows. "There are many ways of looking for a person, you know. Some look to talk; some to deal."
He pours another dram of a foul black market distillate into a teacup. The fumes shimmer as they evaporate.
"Some look to kill." He eyes you for a moment, holding the teacup, then pours it down his throat, coughs, and slams the cup back on the table. "I mention because that? That would cost more."

[Line 1828] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonBarAskInformation:"I'm after information, not killing. It's just talk."
lke_chalcedonBarAskBornanew:"I'm searching for a man called Jethro Bornanew."]

[Line 1829] [Option Selected: "I'm searching for a man called Jethro Bornanew."]
"Jethro Bornanew," the Mammonite repeats as if writing it to permanent memory.
"A name is good. Very specific. I can make inquiries." He smiles, then holds up a finger for the proprietor's attention - another round - then points it at you - you're paying.
"I will set up a meeting with a... friend." He gives you a look, "Not a good friend, not too close. Just a talking friend. Good business, you know."
"5,000 credits. You're a big captain, with a big $shipOrFleet. It's nothing, yes?"

[Line 1831] [Option Selected: "It's just talk, how about 1000?"]
The Mammonite laughs, then stands up to shout for the whole teahouse, "This one, tough negotiator! Watch out, credits are hidden behind Fortress Shield. No one gets in!" 
Other spacers stare, some murmuring disapproval, others laughing.
He sits, rattling the tea-set, and grins at you. "3,000 credits. Is spacelane robbery, but I like you."

You sit back down and transfer the credits.

lke_barEndOut:Make some excuse and leave]

[Line 1840] [Option Selected: Keep the party going]
You drink with the Mammonite, who indeed makes for a good drinking partner. He has many stories, and matches you for tales of scrapes with irate Pathers, pirates, and patrols.
The Mammonite raises a hand to summon the proprietor again. Another pot of 'tea'?

[Line 1840] [Options Given: lke_barMammoniteDrink2:"Why not?"
lke_barEndOut:Make some excuse and leave]

[Line 1842] [Option Selected: Need t'find the lav...]
You're wrapping up your visit to the charmingly quaint facilities when you are grabbed from behind, a dark hood pulled over your head.
You're dragged through a doorway, somewhere with dank; close air; then out into cold night. There's a thrum of raindrops on awnings.

[Line 1843] [Options Given: lke_barMammoniteDrink3b:Continue]

[Line 1844] [Option Selected: Continue]
Sharp, low words are exchanged between your kidnappers - and muffled cursing from beside you. Sounds like the Mammonite.
You're pretty sure you're not as worse for the drink as he is. Pretty sure. Hard to tell with your head in a bag.

You fumble for your sidearm, and find your holster empty. They must have grabbed it.

[Line 1846] [Option Selected: Continue;['lke_barMammoniteDrink4b']]
A gunshot, barely muffled by the sack on your head, claps your eardrums.
You don't hear the Mammonite cursing anymore. The cold shock of dread sobers you.

[Line 1846] [Options Given: lke_barMammoniteDrink5:Continue]

[Line 1847] [Option Selected: Continue]
More low talking. You're dragged a short distance, then lifted to your feet.
"We should speak, face to face. You- let the good $playerBrotherOrSister see."
The hood comes off.

[Line 1848] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Been told you've been asking questions," the man says with a cheap smile. A tooth is missing, another cracked to a point. He smells of mildew, and sweat.
"I'm Sedge." He graciously waves a hand to show you the dismal alley you find yourself in, toward the slumped form sitting in a puddle of its own blood. "Welcome to my Path."

[Line 1850] It's the next day. You see the Mammonite as you walk in and he greets you from the bar - a little worse for the wear after a night of drinking, it seems. 
"Yes, hello captain! You must come meet my friend!"
He stands - unsteadily - and leads you through a door in the back of the bar.

[Line 1850] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonBarNextday2:Follow]

[Line 1851] [Option Selected: Follow]
You step into a storage room. Broken furniture is stacked in a corner. Dim light from a stick-on glowplate has decayed into a sickly yellow-green gradient.
"He's just through here. Come, come," the Mammonite says, beckoning, and steps through a door to the outside.

[Line 1857] [Option Selected: React]
Almost without thinking, you fall to the side to remove yourself from a potential sweep of fire. Tactical chatter whispers in your ear; calm tones. No one is aiming a weapon at you, but your bodyguards can drop anyone nearby at a word.
The closest shape is a shadow; a figure; a man. Not aiming anything at you. Looking at you, hands open and raised part-way.

[Line 1862] You seat yourself. A simple, steaming tea is placed before you with a subtle hint from the proprietor that you need but ask and something much stronger will arrive in a teapot.

You would have thought the tea to be uncomfortably hot, but the man seems unfazed as he swishes it around his mouth and swallows.

"Righteousness is not a scale to be weighed, good deed against evil. Humanity is a being of sin, cursed by the desecration of the Garden of Earth. Nothing will save you but to follow the Path. It is faith that I follow, it is faith that shows me the way, it is faith alone that is salvation."
"I do as I do because I follow the Path. The true Path ends in Heaven. Faith reveals this."

[Line 1880] [Option Selected: "They respect you. Because you are willing to do what needs to be done."]
Sedge nods. "I have what they do not: faith in the Path. I follow where it leads without fear, without question. Faith alone reveals the righteous Path.
"True faith terrifies the faithless." He leans back, his look softening. He is not boastful, but absolutely earnest. "You see how these little spacers, the Hegemony, the Church-liars, all of them; how they fear us."

[Line 1881] [Option Selected: "You do what you want and think faith makes it good? That's insane."]
"It is a good thing you are not God," Sedge cracks a new smile, "Because then I would be in big trouble."

[Line 1882] [Option Selected: "What you say about following faith alone, it... makes sense."]
"Sense is not faith," Sedge says, correcting you. "But maybe you are still finding the Path."
He pauses, then adds, "Maybe we talk more someday, $playerBrotherOrSister, after your business with me."

[Line 1883] [Option Selected: "How can you murder a man in cold blood and think yourself righteous?"]
Sedge's eyes narrow at you. "You say, to kill a man is not righteous? You don't know that Mammonite. I do. But," Sedge grunts, "I need not explain my path to you. God will judge."

[Line 1883] [Options Given: lke_askSedgeMurderA:Change the subject
lke_askSedgeMurderB:"I expect some worldly authority will judge you, and not well." 
lke_askSedgeMurderC:"How much blood must you spill to be allowed into Heaven?"
lke_askSedgeMurderD:"What good deeds of yours outweigh such casual murder?"
lke_askSedgeMurderE:"You killed an evil man? Then I spoke too soon."]

[Line 1885] [Option Selected: "I expect some worldly authority will judge you, and not well."]
Sedge shrugs. "My path will end. Not today, I think."

[Line 1887] [Option Selected: "What good deeds of yours outweigh such casual murder?";['lke_askSedgeMurderC']]
Sedge shakes his head, "You don't understand. You think that way? It shows you worship Mammon and Moloch in your heart and you don't know it."
"Righteousness is not a scale to be weighed, good deed against evil. Humanity is a being of sin, cursed by the desecration of the Garden of Earth. Nothing will save you but to follow the Path. It is faith that I follow, it is faith that shows me the way, it is faith alone that is salvation."
"I do as I do because I follow the Path, not because I think I can buy-," he pauses to spit toward the slumped corpse, "-my way into Heaven."

[Line 1888] [Option Selected: "You killed an evil man? Then I spoke too soon."]
Sedge nods. "My Path crossed his, and his was to end."

[Line 1889] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for a man called Jethro Bornanew."]
"Mm." Sedge looks away, making a show of thinking it over, turning your cup - his now - over and over in his hands. "No, I do not recall a Jethro."

[Line 1890] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for a man called Jethro Bornanew."]
"Mm." Sedge looks away, making a show of thinking it over. "No, do not recall a Jethro."
The pooling blood is caught by a small stream of run-off and begins to wash a red streak down the alley.

[Line 1891] [Option Selected: "And who are you?"]
He makes an expression of mock confusion. "I just said. I am Sedge."
He drops the look. "But you want to know who I am to the Path. Who I am to this world, to people who might come here. Who I am to you. Who am I to what you are looking for."
He corrects himself, holding up a finger, "Whom you are looking for."

[Line 1892] "People find me. Those who seek the Path," he looks at you, the mask of casual ease drawing away to show you the ice-cold, self-assured fervor in his eyes.
"I judge if their path leads true. If it does," he shrugs. Merely the casual business of building an interstellar terrorism network.

[Line 1893] [Option Selected: "You're the recruiter."]
"Is that what I am?" He pauses a moment, then nods, "It is more, people find me. Those who seek the Path."
The mask of casual ease draws away to show you the ice-cold, self-assured fervor in his eyes. "I judge if their path leads true. If it does," he shrugs; merely the casual business of building an interstellar network of terrorism.

[Line 1894] [Option Selected: "You drank my tea."]
"Why say such a thing? It is done," Sedge says.
"Maybe you want it back?" He smiles.

[Line 1895] [Option Selected: "You can't just drink people's tea."]
"I can because I do," he says. The smile sublimes away like ice in vacuum.
"I see you don't understand, spacer."
He keeps his gaze pinned on you as he swipes his hand across the table, sending cup and teapot flying to smash against a neighboring drinking-party. They raise a shout of offense.

[Line 1895] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonBarSedgeRespTea3:Continue]

[Line 1896] [Option Selected: Continue]
A scrape of chairs on floor, and the shouts are quickly hushed by the outraged party's companions. Conversation dies in the room, and everyone at nearby tables takes in the situation. Upon seeing Sedge, they start to quietly file out of the teahouse.
Soon, you are left nearly alone.
Sedge moves his hand through a slow arc, a mockery of blessing, to indicate those who left the room, "They understand."
Another pot of tea and two new cups appear, the proprietor quickly retreating with a crunch of ceramic underfoot.

[Line 1897] [Option Selected: Signal for something stronger from the proprietor.]
You signal the proprietor, who glances at the back of Sedge's head with a questioning look- really? With him right there? You confirm your order with a firm nod.
Soon enough the teapot arrives, smelling of liquor. Two cups are almost dropped and the proprietor retreats.
Sedge watches the whole procedure with his crooked smile, sets the two cups in place, fills them from the pot. He lifts his cup and looks at you expectantly.

[Line 1897] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonBarSedgeCheersA:"To finding lost things." 
lke_chalcedonBarSedgeCheersB:"Are you allowed to drink this?"
lke_chalcedonBarSedgeCheersC:"Got a prayer for this?"]

[Line 1898] [Option Selected: "To finding lost things."]
"And may we recognize truth on the Path of Providence," he adds, "and not turn away."
Then he downs the spirit.

[Line 1899] [Option Selected: "Are you allowed to drink this?"]
"God will forgive me," he says, giving the cup a waggle.

[Line 1900] [Option Selected: "Got a prayer for this?"]
"May we recognize truth on the Path of Providence," he says, "and not turn away."
Then he downs the spirit.

[Line 1901] [Option Selected: "Why did you kill him?"]
"That?" Sedge looks down, as if at a stone on the ground.
"That got careless. That forgot that one does not speak easily of the Path. The Path is sacred. It does not belong in the mouth of a decadent heathen."
His eyes flick downward again, "Like that."

[Line 1902] [Options Given: lke_chalcedonSedgeKillOptA:"That led me to you. Will you shoot me as well?"]

[Line 1907] [Option Selected: "That led me to you. Will you shoot me as well?"]
"No." He smiles again. "You are welcome here, with blessed peace and the hospitality of my people."

[Line 1908] [Option Selected: "I could kill you."]
"Yes." He smiles again. "But, $playerBrotherOrSister, you would not find what you're looking for."

[Line 1909] [Option Selected: "I could have you killed."]
"Yes." He smiles again. "But, $playerBrotherOrSister, you would not find what you're looking for."

He smiles again. "You are welcome here, with blessed peace and the hospitality of my people."

He smiles again. "You are welcome here, with blessed peace and the hospitality of my people."

Sedge leans over to examine it.
"Ah." He speaks without hesitation, "Yes, I remember now. He went to Mazalot."

[Line 1914] [Options Given: lke_sedgeShowPic3:"Mazalot? Why?"]

[Line 1915] [Option Selected: "Mazalot? Why?"]
Sedge considers his words for a moment. Sucking spittle through his tooth-gap.
"That man, his faith is true." Sedge swishes again. "But he... did not know his Path."

[Line 1915] [Options Given: lke_sedgeShowPic4:Continue]

[Line 1916] [Option Selected: Continue]
Sedge stands back suddenly, looking away down the alley.
"That a man could believe, truly, and not know his Path? I did not like to see that. I told him he had no place with us." 
He speaks without meeting your eyes, "I was told he worked for a time, then bought passage to Mazalot."
"I hope they see what I saw, too. That... he is unfit."

[Line 1916] [Options Given: lke_sedgeEnd1:Continue]

Sedge drops like a bag of meat.
There are shouts and screams from patrons. Chaos, and flight. The room empties out, the proprietor ducks behind the bar.

LKE Pather intercept fleet
------------------------------
[Line 1938] The commlink opens with a shudder, error codes flashing from ancient protocols begrudgingly converted to current standards.
The Pather captain stares you down. "$playername," $heOrShe begins.

[Line 1939] "You are known to us. You have spoken in support of the Path that is necessary and righteous to faithful walkers," $heOrShe smiles grimly for a moment, then drops it.
"So if you truly wish to serve the Path, cease your search. Do not pry into our operations, do not ask after one or another 'missing' recruit."

[Line 1940] "You are known to us. You shed blood for the Faith on Jangala by the Hegemony's cruel hand." $HeOrShe smiles grimly, "Yes, we know of you."
$HeOrShe drops the smile, and continues. "Serve the Path again: cease your search. Do not pry into our operations, do not ask after one or another 'missing' recruit."

[Line 1941] "I was told to cut you from the sky, to burn your fleet and scatter your ashes to the blessed vacuum." $HeOrShe smiles grimly, "But then I received a message. Brother Cotton believes that Providence has sung of your role in the final battle."
$HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head, dropping the smile. "I know not what to make of this. Nonetheless, I... ask... that you cease your search for this 'missing' recruit." $HeOrShe sighs, recognizing how pathetic this sounds. 
"Ask yourself," $heOrShe pleads, "Who do you serve by this action? What lies at the end of this Path?"

[Line 1942] "You tread a dangerous path, $playerBrotherOrSister. I was sent here to cut you from the sky and scatter your ashes to the blessed vacuum. I pray that this shall not be necessary." 

[Line 1943] "I will cut you from the sky, burn your fleet and scatter your ashes to the blessed vacuum." $HeOrShe smiles grimly, "This is where your path ends, for you have asked forbidden questions and searched for forbidden things."

[Line 1944] [Options Given: lke_patherFleetNotStopping:"I'm not going to stop my search."]

"But you must," $heOrShe says, almost perplexed. "I shall attack if you do not desist."

[Line 1956] [Option Selected: "I'm not going to stop my search."]
"But you must," $heOrShe says unhappily.

[Line 1957] [Option Selected: "What else did Brother Cotton say? Is that all?"]
"I did not speak with Brother Cotton directly. A message was relayed," $heOrShe looks at you with curiosity and concern as $heOrShe speaks.
"My Path is to obey, so I obey."

[Line 1958] [Option Selected: "I need to contact Brother Cotton. I have something for him."]
"I... it is not my place." $HeOrShe rubs $hisOrHer forehead nervously. "I will... report your words to my superior. I can promise nothing."

[Line 1960] [Option Selected: "You demand what your puny fleet cannot impose. Flee now."]
"I but asked," $heOrShe says, distressed. "And I shall not disobey Brother Cotton's orders. If you will not listen to my words, then I beg you pray. Pray! And listen for the song of the angels, because you will hear no more from me."
$HeOrShe cuts the comms.

[Line 1961] [Option Selected: "You demand what your puny fleet cannot impose. Flee now."]
The Pather shakes $hisOrHer head; grim, determined. 
"In that, you are mistaken. I prayed that our Paths would align, and a fellow $playerBrotherOrSister could walk with me. But here it ends for you- in God's holy vacuum."
The comms are cut.

[Line 1962] [Option Selected: "You demand what your puny fleet cannot impose. Flee now."]
The Pather shakes $hisOrHer head; grim, determined.
"I obey, and I obey unto a righteous death in God's holy vacuum."
That said, $heOrShe cuts the comms.

[Line 1963] [Option Selected: "If that is what the Path demands, I will cease." (lie)]
"Well decided, $playerBrotherOrSister. We share Faith, if not our Path, but that is enough. We must do all in our worldly and spiritual power to halt that so-called church's perversion of Ludd's teachings."
$HeOrShe holds $hisOrHer hands together, "Blessed be this day; may your Path lead you to righteous glory."

[Line 1964] [Option Selected: "If that is what the Path demands, I will cease." (lie)]
"Well decided, $playerBrotherOrSister. We share Faith and a Path, and that must be enough. We must do all in our worldly and spiritual power to halt that so-called church's perversion of Ludd's teachings."
$HeOrShe holds $hisOrHer hands together, "Blessed be this day; may your Path lead you to righteous glory."

[Line 1965] [Option Selected: "If that is what the Path demands, I will cease." (lie)]
"I pray that I could believe you," $HeOrShe holds $hisOrHer hands together for a moment, "But you are not of the Faith, nor of the Path. What value is the word of one who so denies the light of Ludd?"
$HeOrShe lets $hisOrHer hands drop. "Nothing. It is worth nothing. Even the truth, if indeed it is truth, is a lie in your heretic's mouth."

[Line 1966] [Option Selected: "I serve the Faith, and I search for a servant of the Faith. What would battle serve?"]
"You too must pray on this, $playerBrotherOrSister," $heOrShe says with genuine concern. "It is a narrow Path we tread, and easily lost by those who pervert the teachings of Ludd and name their heresy Truth."
"Let me speak truth to you; I wish not to battle you. The strength of the Faithful is wasted when we fight amongst ourselves; and the devil-spawn of the Domain laugh as they watch. They think we're misguided fools, you know."

[Line 1966] [Options Given: lke_patherFleetServeFaithA1:"We are no fools. Save your strength, $brotherOrSister."
lke_patherFleetServeFaithB1:"You would be a fool, and a heretic besides, to stand in my way."]

[Line 1967] [Option Selected: "We are no fools. Save your strength, $brotherOrSister."]
$HeOrShe stares hard into your eyes, at least the holo-image of them, then brings $hisOrHer hands together. "May Providence show me the way; by the stars and the pneuma and the revelation."
After a moment, $personName opens $hisOrHer eyes. 
"Let me speak plainly now: I shall trust your Path. Wherever it leads you, remember what we fight for."

[Line 1968] [Option Selected: "You would be a fool, and a heretic besides, to stand in my way."]
$HisOrHer eyes go hard. "It is as I fear. The false Church has corrupted you. It was said that the Adversary would cloak their lies in the sacrament, and here it is before me."
"May God's holy vacuum purify you," $heOrShe hisses.

[Line 1969] [Option Selected: "I wish to serve the Path; finding Bornanew will serve the cause we share."]
"You must pray on this, $playerBrotherOrSister," $heOrShe says with genuine concern. "It is a narrow and perilous Path we tread, beset by the false teachings of the Church on one side, and by the devil-spawn of the Domain on the other."
$HeOrShe sighs, and brings $hisOrHer hands together. "May Providence show me the way; by the stars and the pneuma and the revelation."

[Line 1969] [Options Given: lke_patherFleetServePath2:Continue]

[Line 1970] [Option Selected: Continue]
After a moment, $personName opens $hisOrHer eyes. 
"Let me speak plainly now: I shall trust your Path. Wherever it leads you, remember what we fight for."

[Line 1972] [Option Selected: "Stand down, $brotherOrSister. I am following the orders of Livewell Cotton."]
"Brother Cotton spoke to you?" $HisOrHer eyes narrow.


[Line 1972] [Options Given: lke_patherFleetSP2:"Yes, over tea. Would that we all could serve the Path with such grace and charm."]

[Line 1973] [Option Selected: "Yes, over tea. Would that we all could serve the Path with such grace and charm."]
"Would that we could indeed," $heOrShe says, perhaps thinking to some slight or misstep $heOrShe observed in the fellow Faithful. 
"It is said that Brother Cotton hears the song of the angels, the whisper of pneuma itself. It is not for human ears, they say." $HeOrShe looks away wistfully, "He is like a prophet of old; touched by the divine." 
Aware of how this sounds, $heOrShe quickly adds, "Not like Ludd, of course. The Word, that is another matter. What I mean to say is that, truly, it must be blessedly glorious."

[Line 1973] [Options Given: lke_patherFleetSP3:"It must; truly we are blessed to walk aside him."]

[Line 1974] [Option Selected: "It must; truly we are blessed to walk aside him."]
"Truly! Oh, I am overcome- forgive me, I must pray."
Putting $hisOrHer hands together, the Pather goes on for some time about how wonderful Brother Cotton is, and how we should all follow his example and be so blessed.
And so on; you put your hands together and mumble something to keep up the act. Soon enough, the show is over, and persuade the Pather that $heOrShe may close the comms without yet another blessing.

[Line 2002] [Option Selected: "Your administrator, Dardan Kato, seems to have a low opinion of 'Luddies'."]
You see $personName wince at the mention of 'Luddies'. $HeOrShe takes a moment. Composing diplomatic words, perhaps.
"It cannot be denied. I pray that he would not be so casual with his scorn. It is... unseemly. If the Mazalot Unification Authority is to be seen as serious about its purpose..."
"Um," $heOrShe is momentarily self-conscious, "But this is no time to talk politics. So. Are you having any trouble with commercial logistics on Mazalot?"

[Line 2003] "Ah," $heOrShe reads something off a datapad. "Captain $playerName? May your time on Mazalot be one of blessed peace."

$HeOrShe gives you a hard look.
"The Luddic Path, you say. 'May be involved'? Look, I can see where you're going and I don't believe it is a good idea."
$personLastName sighs. "The security forces are occupied with hunting the most extreme militants already and, say what you will, but they have a... sense of professionalism about it. They know to respect most of us Faithful. Usually."

"Gens Yaribay?" $HeOrShe sits up straight, "I, er, yes of course."
After a pause, as if $heOrShe was expecting more from you, $heOrShe adds quietly, "It was my understanding that gens Kato was ah, most involved with the situation here on Mazalot?"

[Line 2011] [Options Given: lke_mazalotAskPMYaribayA1:"Kato, Yaribay, what difference does it make?"

[Line 2012] [Option Selected: "Kato, Yaribay, what difference does it make?"]
"Well, er," $heOrShe seems to be gauging whether your question was figurative or literal, then goes with the safe answer.
"It depends a lot on who you ask, er, $playerSirOrMadam. If I was asking the administrator here, Dardan Kato, I would... not emphasize my connection with gens Yaribay."

[Line 2015] [Option Selected: "Is there some kind of problem?"]
"I'm not sure I understand," $heOrShe says smoothly. "My office will do everything it can to facilitate your commercial activities within the Mazalot Unification Authority's sphere of interest, as well as the nearby League trade-lanes."
You hear tapping at a datapad.

"I am sorry," $heOrShe says, something shifting in $hisOrHer demeanor, "But I cannot help you."
$HeOrShe looks like $heOrShe might say more, but instead says "I pray your visit to Mazalot is peaceful, captain," before cutting the comm-link.

"The Church should not... it is not my place to say what the Church should or should not do, particularly if a Reverend Archcurate ordered it, but... you haven't told anyone in the MUA about Church involvement, right?" 
$HisOrHer eyes shift away from the feed, seeing some unfortunate vision, "I can only imagine what Administrator Kato would say if he found out."

$PersonName looks at you for a long time before $heOrShe relents. "You would have my thanks for not mentioning who gave you this information."
"It is common knowledge that Luddic Path activity on Mazalot goes through a man named Nile Virens. The MUA has never got enough evidence to convict him of anything. And if they did, there would be another uprising, anyway. Virens... takes care of people. Charity, of a sort."
"Virens owns a series of compounds located in a few of the larger Luddic-majority settlements, and several in the former-frontiers. He does have a public comms ID, though I can't say whether he'll speak with you."

[Line 2025] [Option Selected: "I understand. I won't tell the administrator."]
"Thank Providence," $heOrShe lets out a breath. "And thank you. The last thing Mazalot needs - the Faithful and the rest, both - is another crackdown. Or an uprising." 
"Little difference," $heOrShe muses idly, "One always leads to the other."
"But um, where were we? My office is happy to assist in facilitating commerce within the sphere of the MUA and associated League-regulated space lanes."

$HeOrShe glances around, then leans a little closer to the comms, "If the administrator finds out you're working for Yaribay, well. He'll make your life difficult. Just so you know.

"The Luddic... Ah." $HeOrShe glances around self-consciously.

$HeOrShe shrugs, "If the MUA questioned every Luddic who spoke against the polity, they'd have to arrest half the planet. It'd be another uprising! No one wants that."

Suddenly, you have his full attention. "Yes, obviously." 
His entire tone has changed into a cloud of blackest suspicion tinged with playful competition.
A pause as he considers you, then says, "Gens Yaribay isn't stupid enough to just... ask... for my cooperation. I am not sure yet about you."

Dardan Kato bursts out laughing. It's a desperate, on-edge sort of break; too many stimulants, you suspect.
He takes a minute to settle down.
"Oh, thank you," he wipes away a tear, "I needed that. What a shift it's been- and then, ah, such patriotism! - Yaribay you said?" He shakes his head, "What a gift. I shall thank them for this excellent jape."

"Don't talk to me."
The link terminates.

"Bornanew, huh," $personName says, growing bored. "Sounds like a Luddie. I'd say check the public directory, but I guess he'd be one of those that thinks it's 'the book of Moloch', right?"
"Look... Captain $playerLastName was it? I have enough problems with keeping the Luddics under control as it is. If you want to find one, ask one."
$HeOrShe turns away to look at another screen, clearly finished with the conversation.

His eyebrows go up. "Horus Yaribay sent you? Here?"
"Gens Kato is looking after Mazalot. Trying to build something here in spite of interfactional meddling. The Yaribays should know that, and you should know better than to interfere."

"You really want to go there?" $HeOrShe looks at you for a moment, then shakes $hisOrHer head when you fail to desist.
"Well. Fine. There's a man, Nile Virens. He's some kind of strong-man in the Path. I swear he's behind half the bombings in the systems, but I can't peg anything on him. You know, legally. So if I touch him, it'll set off the Luddies and we all know what happened last time."
You note, now, that $personName looks seriously stressed out. $HeOrShe could probably use more sleep. And fewer stimulants.

"There's also a comms ID, though," $heOrShe makes a little snort, "He doesn't pick up when 'Servants of Moloch' come calling."
"Captain." $HeOrShe fixes you with $hisOrHer bloodshot eyes. "Please. Don't do anything stupid. Like I said, the Luddies are touchy, and there are more of them than there are us."

It looks like he's considering telling you more dire warnings, but he says nothing as he cuts the comms.

What looks like an expression of terrible regret, poorly hidden, crosses Dardan Kato's face. 
But he says nothing as he cuts the comms.

"And," $heOrShe spares a glance back at the comms, "Don't stir up any trouble. $personLastName out."
The comms cut.

$PersonName looks at you incredulously, then lets out a bitter laugh.
"Are you, now. Great," $heOrShe rolls $hisOrHer eyes, "just what I need: a vigilante. Or a merc?"
"Look, either way about it, I am telling you - ordering you - to not go stirring up trouble with the Luddies. The last thing I need on my watch is another 'incident' to give them an excuse to cause more trouble."
$HeOrShe gives you a look of immense skepticism. "We done?"

"The Church." The words escape from his mouth like an inconvenient prisoner he'd rather everyone forgot. "Here."

"You may not be as lost as you think," he says. "I'm in information technology. Less the tech, more the sales, you know? Distribution of... useful information."

You touch the datapad and its screen flashes to a badge of the Mazalot Unification Authority Municipal Security. The agent gives you a little smile.
"Captain $playerName, by the power of the Mazalot Unification Authority, you are charged with criminal conspiracy under the Interstellar Terrorism Statute of-" 
He drones on in legalese, relishing the act.
You consider your options: you suspect reprisals for dodging out of this entrapment scheme will be token at best - it feels like a credit-rustling op to scam naive spacers more than any kind of serious investigation.

"Captain." The datapad is tucked away, the agent standing up straight, the insincere smile off his face. "I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding.

[Line 2091] [Option Selected: "Agent, you should know that I am a commissioned privateer of the Persean League Fleet."]
The agent freezes mid-speech, looks at you - yes, you mean it - then quickly taps at a datapad, looking between it and you.
"Captain." The datapad is tucked away, the agent standing up straight, the smile wiped off his face. "I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding. The MUA, naturally, fully supports the League Fleet," his eyes meet yours, and he makes a comradely nod, "-and the commissioned privateers who bolster our forces."
"On behalf of Mazalot MuniSec, allow me to render any required assistance with, ah, Fleet operations..."

[Line 2091] [Options Given: lke_mazBarAgentHelp1:"Who runs the Path around here? I need information."]

[Line 2092] [Option Selected: "Who runs the Path around here? I need information."]
Before long, you've got the dossier on one Nile Virens, local Pather strongman, transferred to your datapad. Contact info, addresses, and a patchy bio. Operates compounds in all the major Luddic population centers. Effectively runs the Path on Mazalot.
"You need to watch out for that one," the agent stows his datapad and stands. "Slippery customer, he is. Can't nail him on one thing or another, always some young Luddie will come to confess in his place." The agent looks at you with comradely bonhomie, "Glad they finally called in the big guns. You gonna..." he makes a finger pistol motion, and winks.
"Not that you could tell me, I suppose."

[Line 2092] [Options Given: lke_barEnd:Leave without a word
lke_barEnd3:"Your assistance will be noted in the after action report."]

[Line 2093] [Option Selected: "Agent, I am acting on behalf of an archcurate of the Church of Galactic Redemption."]
"Yeah? Well good for Ludd." The agent holds up his datapad, which blinks a flash at you for a quick holo to register your 'crime'.
"Maybe you can pay your fine with all those tithes you Luddies collect from little old grannies. And it is," another couple taps, "5,000 credits."

[Line 2094] [Options Given: lke_mazBarAgentKatoThreat:"I'm not sure this aligns with Administrator Kato's policies. Perhaps we should comms him and ask?"]

[Line 2098] [Option Selected: "I'm not sure this aligns with Administrator Kato's policies. Perhaps we should comms him and ask?"]
The agent freezes, hunched over the datapad with the spurious 'fine' transaction request blinking. His eyes stare unblinking at you, expression grim. Deciding if you're serious.

[Line 2098] [Options Given: lke_mazBarFineEyeContact:Maintain eye contact
lke_mazBarFine5k:Pay the fine]

[Line 2099] [Option Selected: (raise your voice) "I would think that the MUA would cooperate with a Church investigation into Pather activity."]
Heads turn. The party at a neighboring table does a double-take and decides now is a good time to pay the tab.
The agent fixes you with his eyes, and smirks coldly. "I see what you're trying. The Church doesn't run this polity, the League does."
He stares unblinking at you. Assessing.

[Line 2099] [Options Given: lke_mazBarFineEyeContact:Maintain eye contact
lke_mazBarFine5k:Pay the fine]

[Line 2100] [Option Selected: Maintain eye contact]
You stared down the Excubitor Orbis of Hesperus. A munisec officer from Mazalot? He's nothing. A bilge-roach before the Dragon of Orion.

[Line 2100] [Options Given: lke_mazBarFineEyeContact2:Continue]

[Line 2101] [Option Selected: Continue]
Your gaze sears like plasma, it tears the munisec bully apart like a graviton beam cannon flashing across the blood-and-ash flecked volume of space battle; you've seen things he wouldn't believe. Unimaginable vastnesses, vacuum most terrible and cruel.

[Line 2101] [Options Given: lke_mazBarFineEyeContact3:Continue]

[Line 2102] [Option Selected: Continue]
He drops his eyes to his silly parking-warden's datapad. Bashfully, he tucks it into a pocket while mumbling something about a misunderstanding, and shuffles away.
You stand alone.

[Line 2102] [Options Given: lke_mazBarReturn:Turn back to the bar]

[Line 2103] [Option Selected: Maintain eye contact]
His eyes stare with the dumb authority of a machine set to an aggression routine. There is no human connection, no empathy. You can only imagine this as the look given by a gamma AI stripped of its theory of mind in some dim Tri-Tachyon blacksite.
"The fine," he says, "Is 5,000 credits."

[Line 2103] [Options Given: lke_mazBarAgentOptPunch:Punch the MUA agent in the face and make a break for it
lke_mazBarFine5k:Pay the fine]

[Line 2104] [Option Selected: Pay the fine]
You pay the fine.
"Stay safe, citizen." The MUA agent produces a perfunctory forge-duplicated smile, "This place is crawling with terrorist sympathizers."
He leaves.

[Line 2104] [Options Given: lke_mazBarReturn:Continue]

[Line 2105] [Option Selected: "6,000 credits, then?"]
The official datapad disappears and a different, somewhat more battered one appears in its place. A credits transfer request awaits your confirmation.
"You may pay your, ah, fine right here. I understand that you've expressed remorse for the breach of law, so I'll make sure this incident doesn't appear on your record."
He winks.

[Line 2105] [Options Given: lke_mazBarAgentRespBribe2:Transfer the credits
lke_mazBarAgentOptPunch:Punch the MUA agent in the face and make a break for it]

[Line 2106] [Option Selected: Transfer the credits]
As the transfer chimes complete, the officer makes a perfectly insincere smile.
"Stay safe, citizen," he says.

[Line 2106] [Options Given: lke_mazBarAgentRespBribe3:"Hold on. I paid for information - I expect to get it."]

[Line 2107] [Option Selected: "Hold on. I paid for information - I expect to get it."]
Confusion, then a sneer grows on his face.
"Don't get smart with me, spacer - you don't want to catch me in a bad mood." 

[Line 2108] [Options Given: lke_mazBarAgentRespBribe4:"Shall we call up Dardan Kato and explain the bribe I just paid?"]

[Line 2109] [Options Given: lke_mazBarAgentRespBribe4:"Shall we call up the administrator and explain the bribe I just paid?"]

[Line 2110] [Options Given: lke_barEnd:"Of course. Good day, officer."]

[Line 2111] [Option Selected: "Shall we call up the administrator and explain the bribe I just paid?"]
His sneer fades. You wouldn't be so stupid, his look says, would you? You give a little nod; yes, you would. You've done far stupider and walked away intact.
Before long, you've got the dossier on one Nile Virens, local Pather strongman, transferred to your datapad. Contact info, addresses, and a patchy bio. Operates compounds in all the major Luddic population centers. Runs the Path, such as it is, on Mazalot.
"You deserve each other," the officer grumbles as he makes his exit.

[Line 2111] [Options Given: lke_barEndOut:Leave]

[Line 2112] [Option Selected: Punch the MUA agent in the face and make a break for it]
A solid blow sends the security officer toppling back into a table which obediently flips, spilling glassware and tipsy spacers across the bar.
The MuniSec undercovers that were watching you the whole time from the bar leap to their feet, drawing stun prods. 
You manage to avoid them thanks to the shouting, chaos, and your bodyguards' admirable job of running interference without appearing to be associated with you.

[Line 2112] [Options Given: lke_mazBarAgentOptPunch2:Slip out the back door]

[Line 2113] [Option Selected: Slip out the back door]
As you slip out of the bar, leaving the sound of breaking glass and shouting behind, you reflect that the MuniSec goons were definitely running holo-rec, so it's not a clean getaway. 
But it's also probably not worth the real authorities making too much a fuss about, either. You wouldn't be the first spacer to run from a brawl, not on Mazalot, not anywhere, and allowances must be made for the commerce your type brings to these worlds.
Someone will remember, however.

[Line 2113] [Options Given: lke_barEndGetOut:Get back to your $shipOrFleet]

[Line 2115] [Option Selected: "My name is Finlay Siyavong of Fleet Intelligence and I have questions for you."]
This cop is local munisec, and a corrupt bottom-feeder at that. You know that such a bully is easily bullied if they believe you're higher-ranking. And the Persean League Fleet Intelligence Service is an elite among the League, filled with Gens-heirs.
"Officer." You affect the aristocratic accent of Kazeron and its self-assured authority, "Think very carefully before you respond."

[Line 2115] [Options Given: lke_mazBarAgentRespSiyavong2:Berate the officer]

[Line 2116] [Option Selected: Berate the officer]
"I didn't want to come to this Luddie-infested backwater of a failed terraforming experiment to hunt Pathers, but Intel smelled rot. Do you know what that means? - Don't answer. We have heard reports - disturbing reports - about the accounts of the Mazalot Unification Authority Municipal Security branch."
The officer is on his back heel, sweating. Nearby tables are carefully pretending not to listen to your tirade.
"'Riddled with Pather credits' is what I've heard. And as you well know per the League's Interstellar Terrorism Statute - which you so helpfully quoted for me - that means that central oversight is empowered to intervene in local affairs."

[Line 2116] [Options Given: lke_mazBarAgentRespSiyavong3:Keep berating]

[Line 2117] [Option Selected: Keep berating]
"Do you know what that means? Do not respond, officer, I am not finished."
You continue the dress-down, describing the various powers that the central League executive can hammer down upon members found to be involved in abetting terrorism - Mairaath's millions dead were fresh in the minds of the composers of the League's constitution, and the powers enumerated to stop a repeat of the event are far-reaching indeed.
It is, you reflect, a good thing you paid attention to League history.

[Line 2117] [Options Given: lke_mazBarAgentRespSiyavong4:Continue berating]

[Line 2118] [Option Selected: Continue berating]
Before long, you have the munisec officer silent and near-tears across from you in a booth while you browse local security reports on their datapad using their own login.
You find exactly what you need - Nile Virens, local Pather strongman. Operates compounds in all the major Luddic population centers.
After transferring the information to your own TriPad you toss the officer's datapad across the table. He is too slow to catch it, and it clatters to the ground.

[Line 2118] [Options Given: lke_barEnd:Leave without a word
lke_barEnd2:"Your cooperation will be noted."]

[Line 2122] [Option Selected: "Your assistance will be noted in the after action report."]
The agent's eyes light up at this, and their mouth opens to speak more - but you've already turned away.


------------------------------
LKE Nile Virens contacts you
# after somehow botching the MUA agent bar encounter
------------------------------
[Line 2125] Your comms officer pings you unexpectedly.
"$PlayerSirOrMadam. I received an unusual communication which- I thought it should be brought to your attention."

[Line 2125] [Options Given: lke_mazFreebie1:"What is it?"]

[Line 2126] [Option Selected: "What is it?"]
"$PlayerSirOrMadam. Someone who claims to work for a man named 'Virens' commed to invite you to a meeting. I did not... at first think to bring it to your attention until the details could be verified."
"Well, ah," they twitch nervously. "We verified the details."

[Line 2126] [Options Given: lke_mazFreebie2:"And?"]

[Line 2127] [Option Selected: "And?"]
And indeed, as your comms officer explains, it turns out that one Nile Virens figures prominently in Mazalot as the leader (alleged) of the local branch of the Luddic Path, though none of the mainstream media or data outlets state this apparently unspoken-by-agreement fact. Virens legally runs a number of charities; Pather fronts (allegedly), and owns properties in most of the significant Luddic-majority settlements on Mazalot.
It's not difficult to read between the lines. Just dangerous.
Unless you are someone who employs top-credit bodyguards and operates a private battlefleet.

[Line 2127] [Options Given: lke_mazFreebie3:Someone like me]

[Line 2128] [Option Selected: Someone like me]
It's almost shocking that Virens hasn't been arrested already, but his status is a political minefield for the Mazalot Unification Authority. To crack down might instigate another uprising. To not crack down allows Pather influence to simmer just under the boiling point.
And now, Nile Virens has invited you for tea.
Your officers, of course, have rapidly assembled a tactical report on Virens' holdings for your review.


------------------------------
LKE Comms to Nile Virens
------------------------------
[Line 2130] You execute the command to open comms for Nile Virens. Your interface links to the MUA network, its motto blinking for a moment - something about "diversity of belief and good order" - then forwards through a series of ancient off-the-forge low-power relays displaying embedded logos of the long-dead megacorp that once claimed ownership of the hardware.
Your request hangs in the limbo, request bouncing between nodes on the Mazalot network.
Nile Virens isn't answering.

[Line 2130] [Options Given: lke_virensCommsFirstWait:Have your comms officer babysit the link request
cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 2131] [Option Selected: Have your comms officer babysit the link request]
Your comms officer replies with an appropriately professional level of enthusiasm to the tedious task. In the meantime, you turn to certain routine obligations of running a $shipOrFleet.

[Line 2131] [Options Given: lke_virensComms2:Close the comms interface]

[Line 2132] [Option Selected: Close the comms interface]
Mere minutes later, your comms officer pings you with an update.
Nile Virens never activated the comms; it seems that he "doesn't use comms". But someone who claimed to be an associate did respond, finally, and has relayed an invitation...

[Line 2132] [Options Given: lke_virensComms3:"He's invited me for tea, hasn't he."]

[Line 2133] [Option Selected: "He's invited me for tea, hasn't he."]
"Um," your comms officer is caught off guard. "Yes, $playerSirOrMadam, he has. For tea."
You consider your options.

[Line 2134] It is possible that word of your killing of Sedge has made its way to Virens, whether he uses comms or not. You imagine that he may take a dim view of your action on Chalcedon.


------------------------------
LKE actually meet with Virens
------------------------------
[Line 2137] [Options Given: 3:lke_shuttleToVirens:Take a shuttle down to meet with Nile Virens]

[Line 2138] [Option Selected: Take a shuttle down to meet with Nile Virens]
From the shuttle you admire the atmospheric display resulting from Mazalot's strong magnetic field; spectra flare and break like ocean waves.
Your shuttle is unaffected aside from extra cleanup processing required by the comms and nav systems. 
You land on the outskirts of some Luddic-majority town in what passes for a spaceport: a field of baked gray dust. A long row of sheds might be traffic control, warehouses, or a barn for all you know.

[Line 2138] [Options Given: lke_shuttleToVirens2:Continue]

[Line 2139] [Option Selected: Continue]
A pair of militants wearing dust masks meet you. They're armed, but not conspicuously so.
They lead you through a town of sun-baked brick and slowly corroding salvage. Bright paint and lush gardens manage, just, to stave off a sense of apocalyptic decay.
Soon, you find yourself before a large compound with doors of etched metal. The militants are met by another pair, similarly armed. The most senior among them lowers his mask.

[Line 2140] "$PlayerName. Blessed peace this day. Please, $playerSirOrMadam, follow me."

[Line 2140] [Options Given: lke_shuttleToVirens3:Continue]

[Line 2141] "$PlayerName. Blessed peace," he says, and hesitates. 
"Please. Your weapon." He indicates your sidearm.

[Line 2141] [Options Given: lke_virensGunCheckA:Hand over your sidearm
lke_virensGunCheckB:"Don't worry, I'm not here to shoot anyone."
lke_virensGunCheckC:"I will not surrender my sidearm."
lke_virensGunCheckD:"You'll have to take it from my cold, dead hands."
lke_virensGunCheckE:Return to your shuttle]

[Line 2142] [Option Selected: Hand over your sidearm]
The lead guard accepts it with both hands, giving a little bow, then tucks it into a holster on the front of his webbing. 
A place of honor? Or at least a visible demonstration that he's going to keep a close eye on your gun.

[Line 2142] [Options Given: lke_shuttleToVirens3:Continue]

[Line 2143] [Option Selected: "Don't worry, I'm not here to shoot anyone."]
The guards glance nervously at one another. Someone mutters something at the edge of your hearing.
The leader gives a hiss and they shut up.
"Please, if you would," he says. "You are a guest of Brother Virens. He guarantees your safety on this world."

[Line 2144] [Option Selected: "I will not surrender my sidearm."]
The guards glance nervously at one another, muttering. The leader gives a hiss and they shut up.
"Please, if you would," he says. "You are a guest of Brother Virens. You will not be touched on this world."

[Line 2145] [Option Selected: "You'll have to take it from my cold, dead hands."]
The leader almost looks sad for a moment, then something shifts in his eyes and his expression is left dull but alert.
"Then you will not meet with Brother Virens," he says. "We shall return to your shuttle."
The other guards are tense.

[Line 2145] [Options Given: lke_virensGunCheckE:Return to your shuttle]

[Line 2146] [Option Selected: Return to your shuttle]
Virens' militants escort you back through town. You see clearly now how the population avoids your route, and how you haven't, in fact, seen any MUA personnel. Anywhere.

[Line 2146] [Options Given: lke_virensEarlyExit:Leave]

[Line 2147] [Option Selected: Leave]
You return to your $shipOrFleet without having met Virens.
It seems that he will only meet you if you are totally defanged. Perhaps he does not believe that your marines could 'invite' him to meet you.

[Line 2148] [Option Selected: Continue]
The lead guard does a quick one-two knock on the doors and they swing open. 
The air is cool, the walls hung with cloth woven in bright patterns; wooden furniture prevails. A clean, earthy scent hangs in the air. You are overcome by a sense of ancient wealth - entirely underwhelming compared to the palaces of Eventide or a Tri-Tachyon executive's chateau, but here, you can tell that every object, every surface, has been transformed by the hand and muscle of human beings alone.
You are led up stairs - wooden, creaking unsettlingly - to a room overlooking an interior courtyard garden. The silhouette of a man stirs at your presence.

[Line 2148] [Options Given: lke_virensStart:Continue]

[Line 2149] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Blessed peace upon you," the man says, turning toward you. "I am Nile Virens. I invite you to sit with me."
A finely-carved table is set with a tea set, simple in form and painted with delicate natural motifs.

[Line 2150] You are gaining a sense for the quality of tea by the scent hanging in the air after boiling water is freshly poured.
This is a fine blend.

[Line 2150] [Options Given: lke_virensStartSit:Sit and drink
lke_virensStartStand:Remain standing]

[Line 2151] With all this dealing with Luddics, you realize that you're starting to develop a sense for the quality of tea by the scent hanging in the air after boiling water is freshly poured.
This is the good stuff.

[Line 2151] [Options Given: lke_virensStartSit:Sit and drink
lke_virensStartStand:Remain standing]

[Line 2152] [Option Selected: Sit and drink]
You sit, and Virens pours two cups, then motions for you to choose your pick of the two.
After you do, he holds the cup up for a moment and inhales the steam.

[Line 2153] [Option Selected: Remain standing]
A frown begins in his brow but fails to materialize on his mouth.
"I respect that you shall do as you wish, $playerSirOrMadam," he says, and pours a cup for himself. "My invitation stands, and you have my hospitality regardless."

[Line 2154] [Options Given: lke_virensWhyInvite:"Why did you invite me here?"]

[Line 2159] [Options Given: lke_virensSitForTea:Sit and take a cup of tea]

[Line 2160] [Option Selected: Sit and take a cup of tea]
Virens acknowledges your act with a nod, and raises his cup to you before sipping some tea.

[Line 2161] [Option Selected: "Why did you invite me here?"]
"If I didn't bring you in now, it seems you'd ask everyone in the system about Jethro Bornanew, about the Luddic Path, and ultimately, about me." 
"You are blessedly persistent," he smiles indulgently. "Dangerously persistent, if left to your devices, I suspect. Others would ask why you're asking. The MUA would ask why you're asking. Too much of this asking, asking, asking. It upsets delicate things."
As he speaks, he reaches out and almost, but not quite, touches the fine teapot. He seems to realize what he is doing and pulls back.

[Line 2162] [Option Selected: "Why did you take my sidearm?"]
He gives you a funny look.
"Sedge. On Chalcedon." He raises his eyebrows, "In the back? Surely you will not begrudge my caution."

[Line 2163] [Option Selected: "You're a lot more polite than Sedge."]
Virens' mouth draws a thin line. "He is... was... not a polite man, nor pleasant. Driven, however. Quite driven."
Virens looks thoughtfully at his tea like something is wrong with it, something ineffable.

[Line 2164] [Option Selected: "You're a lot more polite than Sedge."]
He nods, and says "He is not a polite man, nor pleasant. Driven, however. Quite driven."

[Line 2165] "Sedge shot the man who set up the meeting in front of you."

[Line 2166] "I am told that Sedge became... agitated. He was quick to anger, and quick to demonstrate that anger."

[Line 2167] "I knew Sedge to be crude, and to be cruel."

[Line 2168] Virens looks thoughtfully at his tea like something is wrong with it, something ineffable.

[Line 2169] Virens meets your eyes, "Though you are my guest here, and perhaps because you are my guest, I feel that I must demand an answer from you." 
"So I ask you this, $playerName. Why did you kill him?"

[Line 2170] [Options Given: lke_virensKillSedgeKilledMe:"He would have killed me without hesitation, given the chance."

You need Virens to cooperate. Perhaps a lie will help...

[Line 2181] [Option Selected: "He would have killed me without hesitation, given the chance." (lie)]
"I concede that he has, to my knowledge, killed many," Virens says. "And with little hesitation. By the other hand, he did speak with you; he seemed to me not a man to waste his time with talk when intent upon killing." 
"To that point," he picks up his teacup. "The deed is done. Sedge is not mine to avenge, so put any worry of that from your mind."
"You see, I am a man who does hesitate. Thoughtless action," he shakes his head. "But there are times for killing. And, after hesitation - and thought - I see that it be done."
Virens smiles unreassuringly.

lke_virensWhyKillSedgeOut:Speak of other things]

[Line 2182] He stares straight at you. "You did not steal my tea."
"So," he trails off, giving a one-shoulder shrug, tea steady in his other hand. "No."
Just the hint of an unexpected smile lingers.

[Line 2182] [Options Given: lke_virensKillSedgeKilledMe3:"I'm glad we cleared that up."]

[Line 2186] [Option Selected: Continue]
"I understand that Sedge could be rude, yes, and even offensive. But," he shakes his head. "Death is not a thing to administer lightly."
You are certain he has made such administrations himself.

"It is easy to dislike a great many people in a great many circumstances," Virens says. "Sedge, perhaps, easier to dislike than most, I must admit."
"Still. Death is not a thing to administer lightly."
You are certain he has made such administrations himself.

"I see," Virens says coldly. "It would be consistent to level the same charge against myself, yes?"
He looks at you with expectant challenge.

[Line 2191] [Option Selected: "No. You seem different."]
"Do I?" He looks away, brow wrinkling. "Then I feel perhaps I am failing at something." 
He turns back to you, "Nonetheless, it is only God whose judgment for which I truly fear and hope."

[Line 2192] [Option Selected: "He was a brute who ruled through terror." (lie)]
"You are not wrong in that," Virens says. 
"And he died as he lived: through a seemingly random act of wanton violence."
You detect more than a hint of criticism in these words.

[Line 2193] [Option Selected: "He was a murderer. The world is better off without him."]
"Yes. But think of what you've created, back on Chalcedon."
Virens leans forward, "A hero, blessed martyr," he whispers. "Shot in the back by a spacer coward. Sedge now walks beside Ludd, and the children of Chalcedon will walk in his footsteps."
He leans back again. "You've made what was once an inconvenience an immortal, captain."

"So they shall," Virens agrees.

[Line 2197] [Option Selected: "That's rich coming from a Pather. Remember Mairaath?"]
He sighs. "Mairaath, yes. We're told many things of Mairaath. But think of what you've created, back on Chalcedon."

"No," he says, "I cannot."
"But I will not rehash this old argument now. Remember, it is you who came to me, in my home, to ask me for a favor."

[Line 2204] [Option Selected: "He would have killed me without hesitation, given the chance." (lie)]
"I concede that he has, to my knowledge, killed many," Virens says. "And with little hesitation. By the other hand, he did speak with you; he seemed to me not a man to waste his time with talk when intent upon killing." 
"To that point," he picks up his teacup. "The deed is done. Sedge is not mine to avenge, so put any worry of that from your mind."
"You see, I am a man who does hesitate. Thoughtless action," he shakes his head. "But there are times for killing. And, after hesitation - and thought - I see that it be done."
Virens smiles unreassuringly.

"You use this word 'ally'. It is, I think, too strong a word for what was between he and I."
Virens switches his teacup to his other hand, "Nor shall I deny the association, not once or thrice. The Path can be a twisted thing, captain, and ever am I surprised by the company with whom I walk."
"I apologize for nothing but for providing you with an unsatisfactory answer." He pours more tea, "My wife always said I was a middling host."

[Line 2211] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for a man called Jethro Bornanew."]
"Yes," Virens pauses, studying you. "I know."

[Line 2212] [Option Selected: Let it hang; he knows what you want]
With a small, amused nod Virens acknowledges that you've left the gap in conversation for him, not you, to fill.
"I feel that I have some responsibility to Bornanew, you see." Virens flicks a nonexistent speck from his teacup. "Not for him in particular, but for courtesy, shall we say. My meeting with him was brief, and we have had no business or acquaintance since." 

[Line 2213] [Option Selected: "Will you tell me where he is?"]
"I may," says Virens.
"I feel that I have some responsibility to Bornanew." He flicks a nonexistent speck from his teacup. "Not for any particular loyalty. For the general principle. My meeting with Bornanew was brief, and we have had no business or acquaintance since."

"He did, however, tell me why he was sent here. And by who." Virens looks for your reaction.
"I would not wish to direct you to him if your intentions were... unkind."

[Line 2217] [Option Selected: "Well, I don't get paid if I don't return with him. Or his body."]
Virens pulls back, frowning.
"Am I to understand that as a threat, or merely a jest made in very poor taste?"

He gives you a look that contains not a hint of amusement.

[Line 2223] [Option Selected: "It's a job. I'm simply being realistic."]
He gives you a look. He seems more distant from you, somehow.

[Line 2227] [Option Selected: "I have a battalion of marines in orbit. Make this easy on yourself.";['lke_virensThreatenWithFleet']]
Virens leans back, rubbing his chin.
"Captain," he begins, "Whatever you make of my home, this settlement... Mazalot is a polity of the Persean League. Their fleets will hound you to the ends of the Persean Sector."
"I say this to make sure, very very sure, you know what you are threatening to do. So you will see why it is not necessary."

[Line 2227] [Options Given: lke_virensThreatenWithMarines2:"And why is that."]

[Line 2228] [Option Selected: "And why is that."]

"I see," Virens says, looking out into the courtyard. Thinking, for a long minute. He turns back and deliberately sips some tea.

[Line 2239] [Option Selected: "Why help the Church? Are you not of a... wayward sect?"]
"Wayward?" He gives a soft laugh. "You can be diplomatic when you wish it."
"The Church is not all one thing. And do you think this man, this Jethro Bornanew, will help that part of the Church which seeks a dominion of orthodoxy to overcome all the Faithful, and the Sector besides?"
"Of that, I am not sure." His mouth moves toward an amused smile, but doesn't quite get there. "Burn bright, captain."

"But I do know that the Church is not all of one thing. And do you think this man, this Jethro Bornanew, will help that part of the Church which seeks a dominion of orthodoxy to overcome all the Faithful, and the Sector besides?"

[Line 2241] [Option Selected: "That's it? Nothing about 'the Path'?"]
"I felt you would not wish to hear of 'the Path'. But if you wish, I will tell you briefly of the Path."
He looks down, frowning. "The Path is not all alike. In some places, the Path provides something that nothing else will. Not Kazeron, not the Hegemony, certainly not the Mazalot Unification Authority."
He looks up, changed; there is a sad fervor in his eyes that you did not see before. "We were lost. And then the Word found us. Ludd's message shines bright in the dark of space, in the shadow of the powerful. Not even the Church can contain it."
"THAT is the Path." He nearly shouts, standing. Then takes a deep breath, and a moment to smooth his fine clothing.

[Line 2242] [Option Selected: "Why would you, a Pather, help me with this?"]
His lip curls in an ironic smile while his eyes narrow just slightly; some repressed anger, even rage.
"You know little of the Path, spacer. The Path provides something that nothing else will. Not Kazeron, not the Hegemony, certainly not the Mazalot Unification Authority."
He sets his teacup down firmly. There is a sad fervor in his eyes that you did not see before. "Ludd's message shines bright in the dark of space, in the shadow beneath the boot of power. Not even the Church can contain it."

He sets his teacup down firmly, rattling the ceramic. There is a sad fervor in his eyes you did not see before. "Ludd's message shines bright in the dark of space, and in the shadow beneath the boot of power. Not even the Church can contain it."
He stands, and takes a deep breath. Then smooths his fine clothing. "Go in peace," he says.

LKE Nile Virens raid option
------------------------------
[Line 2255] [Options Given: 2:lke_virensRaidStart:Prepare a raid on Virens' compounds to extract Jethro Bornanew]

[Line 2257] [Option Selected: Prepare a raid on Virens' compounds to extract Jethro Bornanew]
You convene your senior officers to discuss an extraction scenario for Jethro Bornanew, presumably employed or taken hostage by Nile Virens. 
It is impossible to completely avoid the MUA's defense network, although even cursory scans show that it is deployed to counter internal uprisings rather than external raids. Persean League casualties can be minimized, but certain sensor stations and defensive batteries will have to be disabled to open the way for a clean assault on Virens' bases.
The Pathers are another problem entirely: separate infiltration squads must simultaneously breach secure compounds located in densely populated settlements. Casual use of heavy weaponry among civilians would attract unwanted interference both in the immediate operation and your future activities. You must strike everywhere swiftly, unerringly, and with a light touch.

[Line 2257] [Options Given: mktRaidNonMarket:Continue]

[Line 2258] You oversee the raid from your bridge, your $shipOrFleet providing EW cover and sporadic fire support for the breaching drones and marine shuttles.
The raid hinges on mere minutes of chaos, comms throughout the hemisphere crackling with static and only tightbeam relays able to pierce the rain of EM scatter amid clouds of chaff and disruption. Casualty reports roll in, displays on your bridge bleeding to fill the space with a bloody glow.
In the confusion, more than one team reports success. This can be sorted out later. As quickly as they landed, your forces perform an orderly withdrawal, laying covering fire while hauling casualties and prisoners.

[Line 2259] Multiple prisoners have been taken and returned to your $shipOrFleet. None matches the admittedly crude biometric data you have on Jethro Bornanew.
Nile Virens himself, however, awaits you in a cell.

[Line 2259] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidFinished2:Go to the brig]

[Line 2260] [Option Selected: Go to the brig]
More than anything, Nile Virens looks tired. Not surprised; he seems to have been expecting you. But tired.
His fine suit, hand sewn from the looks of it, is ripped and dirty. A medic has applied some derm patches; you've already been briefed on his status. Minor lacerations, contusions; nothing serious.

[Line 2261] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidJethro:"I'm looking for Jethro Bornanew."]

[Line 2271] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidCotton3:"Send him a message. Tell him I need to meet with him."]

[Line 2272] [Option Selected: "Guard, get this man some tea."]
A quiet minute passes while some tea is retrieved. Virens stares at you, and you at him.
The guard sets a pot, and two cups down. Virens lifts his hands - bound in a restraint cuff - to the table.

[Line 2272] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidTeaA:Pour the tea.
lke_virensRaidTeaB:Let him pour.
lke_virensRaidTeaC:"Guard, remove those cuffs."]

[Line 2273] [Option Selected: "Who told you I'm looking for Jethro Bornanew."]
Virens closes his eyes for a long moment, like this is making him even more tired.
"You. You did. You asked everyone on Mazalot where to find Jethro Bornanew."
He opens his eyes again. "When the captain of an independent $shipOrFleet comes to Mazalot and asks for someone, I hear of it. Especially after they've done the same thing on Chalcedon."

[Line 2274] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for Jethro Bornanew."]
He smirks wearily.
"Yes," he says, "I can see that all too well, Captain $playerName. You appear to believe that I have him stashed away somewhere."

[Line 2275] [Option Selected: "It looks like I just walked all over your 'path', huh."]
He smirks, though his eyes remain fixed on yours with... yes, that looks like rage long-suppressed, held in a little ball; a spark to light fires for years and years.
"Captain $playerName. I can see that you are not unaccustomed to the use of force. I am not so young a man as I was and have found I have little patience for theater when it comes to matters of... business."
"You want Jethro Bornanew. You believe that I have him working for me, or I've kidnapped him for some purpose."

[Line 2276] [Option Selected: Pour the tea.]
You pour tea in the two cups.
"Blessed peace upon us," Virens says, his voice thick with irony. "I accept your hospitality, and the welcome of your home."

[Line 2277] [Option Selected: Let him pour.]
He lifts his cuffed hands to awkwardly pour tea in the two cups, one after the other.
"Blessed peace upon us," Virens says, his voice thick with irony. "I offer my hospitality, and the welcome of my home: Mazalot, world of dust."

[Line 2278] [Option Selected: "Guard, remove those cuffs."]
The guard moves to Virens, holds the cuffs, and gives a nod to the guard watching through the surveillance feed. A remote command unlocks the cuffs. The guard pulls the cuffs away. Virens wrists are deeply bruised.
He rubs them, eyes still fixed on you.

[Line 2279] He uses the cuffs to shove one teacup toward you, and takes the other in his hands and lifts it, a splash escaping onto the table.

[Line 2280] Virens picks up his teacup. His grip is unsteady, and he splashes some tea onto his hand and the table.

[Line 2281] Option(s) Selected: ['lke_virensRaidTeaDrink', '$removedCuffs']
He blows on the tea and takes a sip. 

[Line 2282] [Option Selected: Have a sip of tea]
The tea is very hot, and not very good. Some concoction of genmod yeasts grown in a vat spinning around some Persean world or other.
Virens matches your action and shows no sign of noticing the quality of the tea.

[Line 2283] [Option Selected: "So you're not going to call me a servant of Moloch? Spawn of Mammon?"]
"No."

[Line 2284] [Option Selected: "You don't sound like much of a Pather."]
"I see no need to perform for you, captain."
He sighs, "You want Jethro Bornanew, I want to return to my home. Let us speak of business."

[Line 2285] [Option Selected: "Do you know Brother Cotton?"]
This he didn't expect. He looks at you, searching, now.
"I know of him," he says. "I would not say I know him. If you are looking for him, I will not be of much use. We... follow different Paths."

[Line 2286] [Option Selected: "I need to speak with Brother Cotton. To give him a message."]
Virens shrugs awkwardly, the cuffs restraining his movement.
"As I said, Livewell Cotton is no associate of mine, nor am I a packet-carrier. I have ways of sending him messages, and I can do so if that is what you demand."

[Line 2287] [Option Selected: "I need to speak with Brother Cotton. To give him a message."]
Virens shrugs.
"As I said, Livewell Cotton is no associate of mine. Nor am I a packet-carrier. I do have ways of sending him messages, and I can do so if that is what you demand."

[Line 2288] [Option Selected: "Send him a message. Tell him I need to meet with him."]
"It shall bring me great pleasure to do so," Virens says, the bilious undercurrent impossible to miss, "upon my return to what is left of my home."

[Line 2289] [Option Selected: "So where is he?"]
"I believe I can answer your questions," Virens says, "If you would allow me to explain the situation."
He clears his throat, ending in an uncomfortable cough, then begins. "Bornanew came to this world asking about the Luddic Path. He had asked similar questions on Chalcedon."

[Line 2289] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidJethro2a:"He met with Sedge."
lke_virensRaidJethro3:Let him tell it]

[Line 2290] [Option Selected: "He met with Sedge."]
He raises an eyebrow. "Yes. He met with Sedge. I did not know this when he came here, but it was soon confirmed by my people."

[Line 2291] [Option Selected: "He met with Sedge."]
He raises an eyebrow. "Yes. He met with Sedge. The man you shot in the back, in a teahouse catering to spacers."
Virens doesn't seem to infuse his last words with any particular judgment.

[Line 2292] [Option Selected: "He met with Sedge."]
He raises an eyebrow. "Yes. He met with Sedge. The man you... saw dead in the alley behind a teahouse catering to spacers."
Virens doesn't seem to infuse his last words with any particular judgment.

"Anyway; we spoke. He told me why he came to Mazalot - the real reason - and who sent him." He gives you a moment to take that in. "I did not offer him employment in any respect. Nor, as it happens, did he want it."

[Line 2296] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidJethro5:Continue]

[Line 2297] [Option Selected: Continue]
"We come now to the crux of our dealing, captain. I know where Bornanew went next. I am willing to tell you, provided you give me my freedom."

lke_virensRaidJethroLie:"Agreed. Bornanew for your freedom." (lie)]

[Line 2298] [Option Selected: "Agreed. Bornanew for your freedom." (truth)]
In response, Virens drops his cuffed hands on the table with a clunk. He looks to you expectantly.

[Line 2298] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidJethroFree:"Guard, uncuff him."]

[Line 2299] [Option Selected: "Guard, uncuff him."]
He nods slowly, watching your face.
He rubs his bruised wrists. "I don't know the coordinates by heart. I shall need a datapad and a standard map of Mazalot."

[Line 2299] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidJethroFree2a:"Guard, get a datapad."
lke_virensRaidJethroFree2b:Pull out your personal datapad]

[Line 2300] [Option Selected: "Agreed. Bornanew for your freedom." (lie)]
You tell him he'll go free, and he is a fool to trust you.

[Line 2302] [Option Selected: Pull out your personal datapad;['lke_virensRaidJethroFree2a']]
He takes the datapad and manipulates the digital map with skill born of familiarity.
After but a moment, he pushes the datapad back across the table to you. A marker has been set on a blur outside of a minor settlement in the southern hemisphere; some homestead. The Luddic settlers did not see fit to submit their names to the Mazalot Unification Authority's survey, so it is named only by a code assigned by a software interpreter.
"That is where he went after we spoke. My watchers in the transport hub have not seen him leave the municipality," he shrugs at this; there are other modes of transport, of course.
"You should speak with Bornanew."

[Line 2303] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidJethroFreeEnd3:"Guard, take Virens to a shuttle."
lke_virensRaidJethroEndThanks:"Thank you."

lke_virensRaidJethroNotSoBad:"That wasn't so hard."]

[Line 2304] [Option Selected: "Thank you."]
He simply stares at you as if this isn't worth a response.

[Line 2305] [Option Selected: "That wasn't so hard."]
He sighs impatiently. "Your vision is narrow, I'm afraid. And I shall not be the man to correct it."

[Line 2306] [Option Selected: "For a Pather, you turn remarkably easily."]
He crosses his arms. "I am no use to my people dead."

[Line 2308] [Option Selected: Leave]
"Wait!" Virens tries to stand, "We had a deal."

lke_virensRaidJethroLie2c:Reconsider your lie]

[Line 2309] [Option Selected: Shoot him]
He sees your weapon and relaxes. Like he understands what you're doing, and accepts it.
It's over in a moment.

[Line 2309] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidJethroLieLeave:Leave]

[Line 2310] [Option Selected: Reconsider your lie]
It might be useful to have a Pather that understands both your power and your mercy.

lke_virensRaidJethroLie2b2:Leave]

[Line 2312] [Option Selected: "What's so funny?"]
"I apologize, captain. I should not make light of your mercy." 
He clears his throat, "It is a strange Path that I have been given. That is all."

[Line 2312] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidJethroLieMUA:Leave]

[Line 2313] [Option Selected: "What's so funny?"]
"I apologize, captain. I should not make light of your mercy."

"But it doesn't end there."

[Line 2314] [Option Selected: Let him speak]
"I will thank them for their mercy; they will extend the hand of compromise. You'll be the great enemy, they the peacemakers."
He looks apologetic, "It won't happen for sure, but when Providence provides, those who truly love God leap to seize it. By the end of this, it is I who might be thanking you."

[Line 2314] [Options Given: lke_virensRaidJethroLieMUA:"I shall await the day."]

Virens is escorted to a shuttle with orders that he handed over to the highest ranking officer of the MUA that can be found. He'll be their problem now.
You return to your command center.

[Line 2317] [Option Selected: "Guard, take Virens to a shuttle."]
Virens is escorted to a shuttle with orders that he be released on the landing pad of wherever they happen to end up. He can figure it out from there; you're certain of it.
You return to your command center.

[Line 2318] You leave the brig and return to your command center.

Talk to Bornanew
------------------------------
[Line 2321] [Options Given: 2:lke_bornanewVisitPlan:Take a shuttle to Bornanew's coordinates]

[Line 2322] Your sensors officer and analysis team perform a thorough scan of the coordinates given to you by Nile Virens.
The location is a lightly populated, poorly developed rural zone on the far fringe of one of the more unremarkable Luddic-majority settlements. The land is nearly barren and bereft of valuable mineral deposits.
Orbital imaging shows a small, struggling farmstead close to the coordinates given. An individual human appears to be present, though it would require observation over a greater time period to fully establish an accurate count of inhabitants. There are also what appear to be a collection of burial sites near the farmstead.
"At least," your sensors officer reports, "that's what it appears to be. Weapons, people; many things can be hidden. Especially with the interference caused by this magnetic field..."

[Line 2323] [Option Selected: Take a shuttle to Bornanew's coordinates]
You order a shuttle prepared for descent to the coordinates provided to you by Nile Virens.

[Line 2323] [Options Given: lke_bornanewShuttle1:Take the shuttle to the surface
lke_bornanewVisitScan:Order a scan of Bornanew's coordinates
lke_prepMarines:Bring a squad of marines as backup
lke_bornanewAbort:Scrub the launch and consider your options]

[Line 2326] [Option Selected: Bring a squad of marines as backup]
You order a half-dozen of your most experienced marines to don surface warfare stealth-op gear.
Their outer suits shimmer and rustle, and six sleek black marines in light armor transform before you into a dusty haze, like a fiery, killing wind of divine vengeance out of some ancient Luddic myth.
You have to but whisper the code-phrase and they will perform a rapid assault to secure your position from most forms of military equipment available on Mazalot.

[Line 2327] [Option Selected: Take the shuttle to the surface]
The spectra of charged particles interacting with Mazalot's atmosphere flare and break like ocean waves.
Your shuttle's descent is smooth, your pilot interfacing with the lackadaisical local traffic control and receiving only token objection to landing near a Luddic-majority settlement.
"Near" is a relative term, of course; you're well over the horizon from all but a half-dozen of the prefab hab units that have been dragged out here and modified by their inhabitants. Half of those appear to be abandoned, the surrounding fields rippled with dust.

[Line 2327] [Options Given: lke_bornanewShuttle2:Continue]

[Line 2328] [Option Selected: Continue]
Your shuttle lands, kicking up a cloud that wafts outward in a diminishing wave over a desolation of erratic boulders and ashy-looking trees.

[Line 2329] Your shuttle lands, and in a blur your marine squad fans out into the surrounding plain, a desolation of erratic boulders and ashy-looking trees.

[Line 2330] Option(s) Selected: ['lke_bornanewShuttle2'];['lke_bornanewShuttle2b', '$market.lke_didMarines']
Before you is a modified prefab hab. A corroded, leaking irrigation system shudders unsteadily as it tends to an unhealthy-looking garden grid. The adjacent crop field is quite dead.
On the flight in, the shuttle sensors tagged a living human figure in the sheltered grove nearby.

[Line 2330] [Options Given: lke_bornanewShuttle4:Approach the grove]

[Line 2331] [Option Selected: Approach the grove]
You follow a path toward the grove. Protected from the parching winds by a low rise, it seems that the trees planted here collect almost enough moisture to survive.
A new run of ceramolith pipe follows the trail to the grove. Like someone wanted to water the trees.

[Line 2331] [Options Given: lke_bornanewShuttle5:Continue]

[Line 2332] [Option Selected: Approach the grove]
You follow a path toward the grove. Sheltered from the dry winds by a low rise, it seems that the trees planted here collect almost enough moisture to survive. But not quite.
Your marines whisper tactical call-and-response in your ear. "$PlayerSirOrMadam," the squad leader addresses you personally, "Target ID confirmed; visual match with Bornanew. Appears unarmed."

[Line 2332] [Options Given: lke_bornanewShuttle5:Continue]

[Line 2333] [Option Selected: Continue]
The shade of the grove is speckled by light filtering through thin leaves.
You find a large man in a long, dusty hooded coat, almost a robe. His back is to you.
There are a handful of Luddic grave-markers here; brightly painted with natural pigments. These look well maintained. 
The man's head is bowed, his hands clasped in prayer.

[Line 2344] [Option Selected: "Wait- what was that about the 'song of angels'?"]
"Oh, um." He looks at you to see if you're really asking this, now. You are.
"There are... writings around Ludd. From the early disciplines, recorded later. They tend to be heavily, ah, corrected toward the Church's rulings in accordance with Ludd's wishes. Or what is known of them. Others, unofficial copies, have been created by con-artists and heretics to prove their own schemes and cults. These, the Knights purge. Some are kept as examples. For teaching; heretic-finding."

"To be so blessed must be a burden beyond all knowing," Bornanew says grimly.

[Line 2354] [Option Selected: "It sounds like a neurological issue."]

"It is not the time for theology," Bornanew says agreeably.

"I pray for your strength," he says.

[Line 2368] [Option Selected: "'Path of light'? Brother Cotton told me the same thing."]
"Truly?" Bornanew shakes his head, "Now it is I who is tested by a fearful omen."

[Line 2369] [Option Selected: "I heard the music when we encountered a strange ship. It used exotic technologies unknown to even the Domain."]
"That sounds like a fearful omen," Bornanew says earnestly.

[Line 2370] [Option Selected: "That ship, the Ziggurat, is in orbit. In my fleet."]
Almost unconsciously he looks up to the sky, and says "Ludd's grace preserve us."

[Line 2371] [Option Selected: "What am I supposed to do with a 'fearful omen'?"]
He lets out a sigh.
"Reason as well as life are gifts of the Creator. We are tested by confrontation with divine mystery. We must decide if we follow the highest path, or merely the most convenient."
He speaks more quietly, "It is a test. When the time comes, will you walk the path of light?"

[Line 2372] [Option Selected: "I heard the music when we scanned the Gates, the Domain Gates, using a new method."]
"The doctrine of the Church tells us the Gates are a product of technological sin. I'm sure you know this," Bornanew says, watching you carefully. "Ludd's words, as far as we know them, do not put it quite so simply."

[Line 2377] [Option Selected: "The Gates are dangerous. They must be studied carefully."]
"One must be careful around great and terrible works such as the Gates. Even your science suggests that observation may change both subject and observer."

"Just as well, then. But I suspect few of the great factions share your intent."

[Line 2379] [Option Selected: "Just as well, because I intend to avoid them."]
"Just as well, then," Bornanew says, as if you've both just agreed to not discuss something. "I suspect the great factions will do little to avoid them."

[Line 2380] [Option Selected: "Never mind. It's not important now."]
"Of course. It is not now the time for theology," Bornanew says, watching you carefully.

He unclasps his hands and turns to you. "Yes. I am Jethro Bornanew."

[Line 2384] [Option Selected: "Did you lose someone?"]
He unclasps his hands and turns to you. "No," he says. He glances back at the graves. "This farm - what's left of it - they built it. So I was told."

[Line 2385] [Option Selected: "Did you lose someone?"]
"No," he says, looking at the graves. "I never met them. Not when they were alive, I mean."
"This farm - what's left of it - they built it. So I was told."

[Line 2390] He looks over your uniform, then past you toward the ridgeline.
"You came a long way. And you brought warriors." He turns back to the graves, "I've counted two, so far."

[Line 2391] [Option Selected: "Is that your farm?"]
"It is." He looks down at the graves. "It was."
"I've discovered that I'm a poor farmer, captain. It seems like everything withers at my touch."

[Line 2392] [Option Selected: "Can I call you 'Jeff'?"]
He gives you a strange look. "If you really want to, I suppose."

[Line 2392] [Options Given: lke_jethroJeffA:"Jeff it is. More efficient."
lke_jethroJeffB:"Jeff it is. It's less... you know."
lke_jethroJeffC:"I'm not being serious. Your name is Jethro."]

[Line 2393] [Option Selected: "Jeff it is. More efficient."]
"Less Luddic, you mean," he says with a smirk. "I understand."

[Line 2394] [Option Selected: "Jeff it is. It's less... you know."]
"Less Luddic," he says with a smirk. "I understand."

[Line 2395] [Option Selected: "I'm not being serious. Your name is Jethro."]
"Ah," he smiles awkwardly. 
"I apologize. This is all... not a shock, exactly. A rather large turn on the path that I have found to be my life, I suppose. It is a lot to reflect upon, now that it is happening."

[Line 2396] [Option Selected: "What happened with infiltrating the Path? You had a mission."]
"I failed," he says.
After a moment, he speaks again, "And I confess, I wanted to fail. After meeting the recruiter on Chalcedon..." Bornanew shakes his head.

[Line 2396] [Options Given: lke_jethroWhatSedge:"Sedge?"
lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled:"Sedge? Don't worry, I killed him."]

[Line 2397] "I failed," he says.
After a moment, he speaks again, "And I confess, I wanted to fail. After meeting the recruiter on Chalcedon..."
Bornanew shakes his head.

[Line 2397] [Options Given: lke_jethroWhatSedge:"Sedge."]

[Line 2400] [Option Selected: "Sedge."]
"Yes," he looks surprised, "That was his name. I did not like the man. I did not like the things I would have to do to make him like me."
Bornanew looks away, "He seemed to be someone I might have been if I had lived a different life. Walked a different path."

[Line 2400] [Options Given: lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled:"Don't worry, I killed Sedge."
lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled2A:"The deed is done. Or not done, in your case. Let it go."
lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled2B:"But you're not him. That's why Jaspis wants you back."
lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled2C:"You'll have to learn to be a lot less squeamish if you're to be a Knight."]

[Line 2401] [Option Selected: "Don't worry, I killed Sedge."]
"You- what?" He looks you in the eyes, to confirm that you are telling the truth. He quickly discovers that you are.
"I have no words," he says, shaking his head.

[Line 2401] [Options Given: lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilledA:"Aren't you a Knight Initiate? How can you be so squeamish?"
lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilledB:"Don't worry about it."
lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilledC:"You could try 'thank you'."]

[Line 2402] [Option Selected: "Aren't you a Knight Initiate? How can you be so squeamish?"]
"I might not be when I get back," he admits.
"But you're right. It is probable that a Knight will be called upon to kill to defend the Faith. It is what I agreed to, what I swore I would learn."

[Line 2402] [Options Given: lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled2A:"Look, this one was on me. Don't worry about it."
lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled2B:"See? This is why you're the man for whatever Jaspis is up to."
lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled2C:"It gets easier with practice."]

[Line 2403] [Option Selected: "Don't worry about it."]
"I feel that I must," he says. "In one sense, his death is due to my choices, though I had no way of knowing it."
"It is true also that he was, by all accounts - and indeed in my judgment - an evil man. His faith twisted in upon itself. It shielded him from remorse for his... actions."

[Line 2403] [Options Given: lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled2A:"You're worrying about it. I told you not to."
lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled2B:"See? This is why you're the man for whatever Jaspis is up to."
lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled2C:"It gets easier with practice."]

[Line 2404] [Option Selected: "You could try 'thank you'."]
"I cannot do that," he says.
"I do concede that he was, by all accounts and indeed my judgment, an evil man. His faith, it was twisted in upon itself. It shielded him from remorse for his... actions."

[Line 2404] [Options Given: lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled2A:"... You're welcome."

lke_jethroWhatSedgeKilled2C:"It gets easier with practice."]

[Line 2406] [Option Selected: "... You're welcome."]
He nods hesitantly, and says "Then I will speak no further on this matter."

[Line 2407] [Option Selected: "See? This is why you're the man for whatever Jaspis is up to."]
He gives you a skeptical look, "That worries me all the more."

[Line 2408] [Option Selected: "It gets easier with practice."]
"Your words are a cold comfort, captain."

[Line 2409] [Option Selected: "Why does Jaspis want you back so badly?]
"The Reverend Archcurate," he says automatically.
"Sorry," he adds quickly. "Habit. They really drill it into you in the Church. Archcurate Jaspis... told me I could call her Sophronia, as if I was family."
"She wants to change the path of the Faith, I believe. She believes I can help her do it."

[Line 2410] [Options Given: lke_jethroWhyOptA:"But you're just one person."]

[Line 2411] [Options Given: lke_jethroWhyOptB:"People died for me to find you."]

[Line 2415] [Option Selected: "But you're just one person."]
"So was Ludd," he says, and laughs. 
"Ah," he catches himself, and wipes his eyes. "Forgive me my blasphemy. I do not believe I am Ludd; I do not hear God's word in the songs of angels."

[Line 2416] [Option Selected: "People died for me to find you."]
He sighs deeply. "Was it necessary?"

[Line 2416] [Options Given: lke_jethroWhyOptBnotImp:"That's not important now. I have a mission to complete."
lke_jethroWhyOptByes:"Yes. In conflicts between the powerful, that's how it works."
lke_jethroWhyOptBno:"No. I may have overreacted."]

[Line 2417] [Option Selected: "That's not important now. I have a mission to complete."]
"Gilead," he says, staring at the graves.

[Line 2418] [Option Selected: "Yes. In conflicts between the powerful, that's how it works."]
He looks at you uneasily, but says nothing.

[Line 2419] [Option Selected: "No. I may have overreacted."]
"I see," he looks at you uneasily.

[Line 2420] [Option Selected: "No one else seems to think much of you."]
He shrugs. "The Reverend Archcurate does. And that was enough to bring you here, for me."
He glances over at you, "I don't care to speculate about how many credits she's wasting on me."

[Line 2421] [Option Selected: "She's getting a bit old."]
"Yes," he says and glances at you. Expecting some news of Jaspis' health, maybe. He turns away again.
"Time comes for us all. I expect she sees that. She wants to leave behind a world... that's better, I think."

[Line 2421] [Options Given: lke_jethroWhyOptEa:"An admirable cause."
lke_jethroWhyOptEb:"A hopeless dream."
lke_jethroWhyOptEc:Say nothing.]

[Line 2422] [Option Selected: "An admirable cause."]
He grunts acknowledgement, looking down at the brightly painted graves.

[Line 2423] [Option Selected: "A hopeless dream."]
He doesn't respond. Just looks down at the brightly painted graves.

[Line 2425] [Option Selected: "If you like, I can have found you dead here."]
He quickly turns to stare at you with a strange intensity. "I-," he begins, and his words catch in his throat. He breathes heavily for a moment, almost unsteady on his feet.
"No," he says. "I'm coming with you to Gilead. It's what I have to do."

[Line 2425] [Options Given: lke_jethroDeadHopelessA:"Feeling okay?"
lke_jethroDeadHopelessB:Give him a moment
lke_jethroDeadHopelessC:"Don't die for real on me, now."]

[Line 2426] [Option Selected: "Feeling okay?"]
"No," he says, then "Yes, I mean. I'm fine. Just, the answer is no. I'm coming with you to Gilead. It's what I have to do."

[Line 2427] [Option Selected: Give him a moment]
"No," he says. "The answer is no. I'm coming with you to Gilead. It's what I have to do."

[Line 2429] [Option Selected: "If you like, I can have found you dead here."]
He quickly turns to stare at you with a strange intensity. "I-," he begins, and his words catch in his throat. He breathes heavily for a moment, almost unsteady on his feet.

[Line 2429] [Options Given: lke_jethroDead1a:"Feeling okay?"
lke_jethroDead1b:Give him a moment
lke_jethroDead1c:"Don't die for real on me, now."]

[Line 2430] [Option Selected: "Feeling okay?"]
After a moment, he lets a breath out, and then almost - but not quite - casually wipes a sleeve across his face. His eyes are red, you see.
"Yes. Yes, I am well. Is your offer serious? You would do this thing for me?"

[Line 2431] [Option Selected: Give him a moment]
He lets a breath out, and then almost casually wipes a sleeve across his face. His eyes are red, you see.
"Forgive me," he clears his throat. "Is your offer serious? You would do this thing for me?"

[Line 2432] [Option Selected: "Don't die for real on me, now."]
After a moment, he lets a breath out, and then almost - but not quite - casually wipes a sleeve across his face. His eyes are red, you see.
"Yes. Yes, I am well. Is your offer serious? You would do this thing for me?"

[Line 2433] [Options Given: lke_jethroDeadOut1:"Yes. Just say the word."
lke_jethroDead3a:"Of course. I just need a body to substitute." (look pointedly at the graves)
lke_jethroDead3b:"I'm afraid I cannot. The Archcurate gave me a mission and I intend to complete it."]

[Line 2434] [Option Selected: "Of course. I just need a body to substitute." (look pointedly at the graves)]
"No," he says with a sudden ferocity.
He catches himself, then begins again, more calmly, 
"And no, forget about all of that. I'm coming with you to Gilead. I have to."

[Line 2435] [Option Selected: "I'm afraid I cannot. The Archcurate gave me a mission and I intend to complete it."]
"Of course," he says quietly. "I have a duty; I made a promise."

[Line 2436] [Option Selected: "Yes. Just say the word."]
He looks, struck silent, at the light coming through the trees.
"Let someone else walk my path."
He turns to you. "I accept. Tell Jaspis... tell her... I should write something, maybe..."

[Line 2436] [Options Given: lke_jethroDeadOut2b:"No. You must live for yourself now."
lke_jethroDeadOut2a:"You should. It will help. She was... emotional."]

[Line 2437] [Option Selected: "You should. It will help. She was... emotional."]
He sighs, covering his face with his hands. "I can't do this. I'm sorry."
"I have a duty. I made a promise. It's what I have to do."

[Line 2438] [Option Selected: "No. You must live for yourself now."]
"But..." he falls silent.
In a long minute, he appears to accept your words.

[Line 2438] [Options Given: lke_jethroDeadOut3:Continue]

[Line 2439] [Option Selected: Continue]
"This is it then," he turns and looks at you once more.

[Line 2439] [Options Given: lke_jethroDeadOut3a:"It is. Burn bright, burn long." (leave)
lke_jethroDeadOut3b:"It is. Blessed be your path." (leave)
lke_jethroDeadOut3c:"It is. Keep your head down." (leave)]

[Line 2442] [Option Selected: "It is. Keep your head down." (leave)]
You walk from the graves, from the dry grove, and return to your shuttle, and it returns you to your $shipOrFleet.
Jethro Bornanew - the man who was once called Jethro Bornanew - is a free man now. Free of his oath, free of schemes; free to live his next life, whatever it may be.

[Line 2442] [Options Given: lke_jethroDeadOut4:And about the body...]

[Line 2443] [Option Selected: "It is. Keep your head down." (leave)]
You walk from the graves, from the dry grove. Your marine squad falls in like spirits of the desert summoned to material form.
Jethro Bornanew - the man who was once called Jethro Bornanew - is a free man now. Free of his oath, free of schemes; free to live his next life, whatever it may be.

[Line 2443] [Options Given: lke_jethroDeadOut4:And about the body...]

[Line 2444] [Option Selected: And about the body...]
Finding a body to substitute for Bornanew is not difficult. One that appears to have died a violent death, but at least a quick death?
Shot in the back by a Pather seems likely, but too dramatic. An accident, then; even easier. A thruster malfunction at the docks. Over in a split second, and no one really to blame except slipshod safety/control measures. One of those unhappy little events that Providence provides to bring an unexpected end to the path of life... and which burns away obvious identifying features.
The Reverend Archcurate will accept a closed-casket burial, you think.

[Line 2445] [Option Selected: "Come on then, let's go." (leave)]
You and Bornanew walk from the graves, from the dry grove.
"There's nothing here I need," Bornanew says as you pause before the dying farmstead. "I am prepared to leave."
The shuttle returns you to your $shipOrFleet.

[Line 2446] [Option Selected: "Come on then, let's go." (leave)]
You walk with Bornanew from the graves, from the grove. The marine squad falls in like spirits of the desert summoned to material form.
"There's nothing here I need," Bornanew says as you pause before the dying farmstead. "I am prepared to leave."
The shuttle returns to your $shipOrFleet.

LKE return to Gilead with Bornanew; he's "dead"
------------------------------
[Line 2450] [Options Given: lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis2:"I found Bornanew."]

[Line 2451] [Option Selected: "I found Bornanew."]
"And." Her tone is flinty; she is not unperceptive.

[Line 2451] [Options Given: lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis3:"I have his body for you." (lie)
lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis5:"I told him I would tell you he is dead."]

[Line 2452] [Option Selected: "I have his body for you." (lie)]
"I understand," she says. A wall of ice, betrayed only by a glint in her eyes.
"Have him sent down. I shall compel the Knights to make the correct arrangements."
She pauses, taking a deep breath.

[Line 2452] [Options Given: lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis4:Continue]

[Line 2453] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Captain. You have provided me... closure. You shall receive your compensation. May Providence guide us, may God forgive us."
She closes the link somewhat abruptly, sending you to a CGR standby mode which is quickly picked up by an aide who arranges the credits transfer, and a flight path for the shuttle to deliver the body.

[Line 2454] [Option Selected: "I told him I would tell you he is dead."]
After a long, long moment she speaks.
"I understand," she says, a wall of ice.
"Was the notion his, or yours?"

[Line 2454] [Options Given: lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis5a:"Mine."
lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis5b:"His."
lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis5c:"It doesn't matter."]

[Line 2455] [Option Selected: "Mine."]
She nods, slowly, with the weight of her years.

[Line 2456] [Option Selected: "His."]
She nods, slowly, with the weight of her years.

[Line 2457] [Option Selected: "It doesn't matter."]
"Perhaps it does not," she says in bitter agreement.

[Line 2458] Option(s) Selected: ['lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis5c']

[Line 2458] [Options Given: lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis6a:"I gave you the truth. Is that not enough?"
lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis6b:"I accept that failure because I have freed a man."
lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis6c:"Do you want me to go kidnap him?"
lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis6d:"Would it make you happy if I shot Bornanew and brought back his body?"]

[Line 2459] [Option Selected: "I gave you the truth. Is that not enough?"]
"It is not," she says sharply. "But it is all I have, so upon it I shall subsist."
A long pause, and then, "You shall receive your credits."

[Line 2459] [Options Given: lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis6a2:Continue]

[Line 2460] [Option Selected: Continue]
She closes the link abruptly, sending you to a CGR standby mode. An instant later, a secretary activates the comms to arrange for the credits transfer in a terse transaction.

[Line 2461] [Option Selected: "I accept that failure because I have freed a man."]
"What a joyous world is yours," Jaspis says, "where all may be free as they like with little concern of the evil permitted reign by their dereliction of God-given necessity."
A pause, then, "You shall receive your credits."

[Line 2461] [Options Given: lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis6b2:Continue]

[Line 2462] [Option Selected: Continue]
She closes the link abruptly, sending you to a CGR standby mode. An instant later, a secretary activates the comms to arrange for the credits transfer in a terse transaction.

[Line 2463] [Option Selected: "Do you want me to go kidnap him?"]
"No. Leave him. Free will was given to us by God that we would use it, and err."
A pause, then, "You shall receive the credits."

[Line 2463] [Options Given: lke_returnToGileadDeadJaspis6c2:Continue]

[Line 2464] [Option Selected: Continue]
She closes the link abruptly, sending you to a CGR standby mode. An instant later, a secretary activates the comms to arrange for the credits transfer in a terse transaction.

[Line 2465] [Option Selected: "Would it make you happy if I shot Bornanew and brought back his body?"]
She gives you a surprisingly fierce look through old, blind eyes.
"No. Leave the matter closed. We shall not speak again."
She closes the link.

[Line 2469] [Option Selected: "I found Bornanew. He's here, with my $shipOrFleet."]
"Heavens rejoice!" A ray of unselfconscious joy breaks through the Archcurate's well-tended walls.
"You must bring him here, I must see him," she pauses, then laughs at herself. "You know what I mean. Come now, I shall have the Knights forgo their accustomed rigidity."

[Line 2469] [Options Given: lke_returnToGileadJaspis3:Continue]

[Line 2470] [Option Selected: Continue]
She cuts her end of the comm-link with unusual speed, leaving you with a static holding image provided by the Church: a human silhouette descending to Gilead on a beam of light.
An implausible image at best.

[Line 2472] [Options Given: 3:lke_shuttleDownBornanew:Take a shuttle with Bornanew to the surface]

[Line 2473] [Option Selected: Take a shuttle with Bornanew to the surface]
Your shuttle is given an unusually expedient flight path to the complex housing Jaspis' office.
Bornanew watches the green world of Gilead grow below you.

[Line 2473] [Options Given: lke_endingJaspisStart:Let him watch
lke_endingStartA:"It's no Mazalot, is it."
lke_endingStartB:"How are you doing, $global.jethroName?"]

[Line 2474] [Option Selected: "It's no Mazalot, is it."]
He smiles, acknowledging the absurdity of your statement.
"Mazalot wasn't all bad. There was a sort of freedom there that can't be found on Gilead, though much danger as well."
He turns back to the view, "I did miss the green." 

[Line 2474] [Options Given: lke_endingJaspisStart:Continue]

[Line 2475] [Option Selected: "How are you doing, $global.jethroName?"]
He smiles politely.
"Apprehensive, I confess. I believe I shall be punished by the Knights, though the Reverend Archurate may try to shield me. I shall ask her not to. An oath is an oath."
"I suspect there will be much silent contemplation and scrubbing of floors." He looks thoughtful, "They do like that sort of thing. I don't mind it."
He turns back to the face of Gilead.

[Line 2475] [Options Given: lke_endingJaspisStart:Continue]

[Line 2476] [Option Selected: Continue]
You are met on the landing pad by a solemn Luddic Knight and attending Knight Initiate. The Knight's frown deepens noticeably as they take in Bornanew. 
Knight Ailanthus leads you to Archcurate Jaspis' office in otherwise judgmental silence. Bornanew takes this treatment in stride, enjoying the gardens and fresh air.

[Line 2476] [Options Given: lke_endingJaspis1:Continue]

[Line 2477] [Option Selected: Continue]
As you enter Jaspis' office, Knight Ailanthus inhales to announce you - and the Archcurate interrupts. 
"Jethro, here you are!" she says, "Providence provides!" Knight Ailanthus lets out a cough, and Jaspis responds by waving them away.
"As well, I must attest, by way of the efforts of the good captain whose footsteps I hear also," she says, smiling, "For lest we forget, the Path of the righteous will not walk upon itself, is that not so?"

[Line 2477] [Options Given: lke_endingJaspis2:Continue]

[Line 2478] [Option Selected: Continue]
Bornanew takes Jaspis' small, frail hand in his own.
"Yes, of course. Please, Mother Sophronia, you must not get too excited. It is just me, and I have caused you much distress."
"Yes and truly, " she says, shaking Bornanew off. "And for it you've already decided to undergo some senseless display of penance, I doubt not. An unseemly habit learnt from the Knights."
"Captain," she turns toward you. "You must grow tired of this, so I shall be succinct: you have my deepest gratitude. My secretary shall see that you receive your payment."
She aims herself at the doorway, "Degory, attend!"

[Line 2478] [Options Given: lke_endingWrapup1:"Good luck, $global.jethroName."
lke_endingWrapup2:Leave]

[Line 2479] [Option Selected: "Good luck, $global.jethroName."]
As you leave with Degory, you hear Jaspis address Bornanew.
"The balance of power is changed; both I and the Faith's future have need of you. But..."
"Why 'Jeff'?" she asks.
You don't hear his reply.

[Line 2479] [Options Given: lke_endingWrapup2:Continue]

[Line 2480] [Option Selected: "Good luck, $global.jethroName."]
Bornanew puts his hands together and nods his head.
Blind to his response, Jaspis begins to address him, "The balance of power is changed; both I and the Faith's future have need of you..."

[Line 2481] [Option Selected: Continue]
The soft-spoken secretary, Degory, produces an incongruous datapad from her robes and conducts the transfer of the Archcurate's payment to your accounts. She then summons the grim-faced Knight Ailanthus to escort you to your waiting shuttle. 
Your return to orbit is uneventful.

LKE generic Jaspis talk during mission
------------------------------
[Line 2484] You speak first with some kind of secretary who politely persuades you to wait patiently.
After a short time, the image of the Archcurate Jaspis appears. She makes little effort to look toward comms feed as she putters around her office.
"It is good to hear from you, captain," she says. "Have you found Novice Bornanew?"

[Line 2484] [Options Given: lke_jaspisTalkNotYet:"Not yet."

[Line 2507] [Option Selected: Accept the link from Bornanew;['BFIN_start2b']]
"Captain $playerName. I do not forget your assistance." He makes a crooked smile.
The link is poor-quality; his voice is hollowed, lacking the warmth you remember.
"I would ask, beg if I must, for your service once more."

[Line 2507] [Options Given: BFIN_start3:"What do you ask?"]

[Line 2508] [Option Selected: "What do you ask?"]
"What I ask, it is a part of the penance I must serve." He raises a hand, as if to stop your objections, "I do also believe it will also serve a spiritual and intrinsic good." 
"And," he clears his throat, "for your assistance, a substantial reward of credits has been authorized by the Reverend Archcurate Jaspis."
"The service..." He releases a breath. "An object considered holy by some in the mother Church has appeared in the possession of a wealthy collector."

[Line 2508] [Options Given: BFIN_start3a:"There's been a theft?"
BFIN_start3b:"Did this collector not make a large enough tithe?"]

[Line 2509] [Option Selected: "There's been a theft?"]
"No," he says, looking up. "That would have been simple. This object, this 'relic', is by all appearances still untouched on Tartessus, in the archives of the Cathedral of Holy Exodus."
"The curates of the archive were in some panic at word that they had lost a holy relic. They checked very, very carefully. I too have personally confirmed that it remains in their keeping."

BFIN_start4b:"And this is embarrassing to the Church?"]

[Line 2510] [Option Selected: "Did this collector not make a large enough tithe?"]
"Ah," he gives a weary smile. "The collector is quite secular, and has no relationship with the Church."

[Line 2511] [Option Selected: "So it's a fake. No problem."]
"But it could be," $global.jethroName says hesitantly. "It raises... questions."

"It could be," $global.jethroName says. "This collector has not been silent about his new acquisition."

"If you choose to assist me," he says, "then I shall share with you what, ah, 'intel' I have managed to piece together."
He looks almost embarrassed for a moment, then forces himself proceed. "Credits, yes. I have also been instructed to offer a payment of 50,000 credits when - if - you join my investigation, and an additional 50,000 credits upon completion of my quest."
"If it is possible." He sighs, "And that I cannot promise."

[Line 2528] [Option Selected: "50,000 credits? That's what Jaspis paid me to get you back."]
"Truly?" He sighs, deflated at this revelation. "The arighting of one errant novice cannot be worth that sum."

[Line 2529] [Option Selected: "50k down, and how much on completion? You didn't say."]
"My apologies," he says, opening a battered notebook. "I am unused to this sort of, of bookkeeping."
"Yes, 50,000 upfront, and another 50,000 credits upon resolution. It is hoped that the false artifact might be removed from consideration, one way or another."
He gives you a questioning look. "Without causing an interfactional incident, that is."

[Line 2530] [Option Selected: "Remind me, there was mention of payment..."]
"Of course," he says, opening a battered notebook. "The Church anticipates expenses. Well," he grimaces, "Reverend Archcurate Jaspis does."
"Yes, 50,000 upfront, and another 50,000 credits upon satisfactory resolution. It is hoped that the false artifact might be removed from consideration, one way or another."
He gives you a questioning look. "Without causing an interfactional incident, that is."

[Line 2531] [Option Selected: "Just much penance are they going to make you do?"]
"This is only the beginning, I am certain," he says with resigned humor. "Violation of Knightly vows is no small falsity, and I am uncertain even that I am truly meant to 'solve' this task set before me."
He pauses, then speaks more quietly, "I fear that my failure might be intended to chasten Jaspis. The Reverend Archcurate, I mean." He looks upward, and lets out a sigh. "She has put altogether too much faith in me."

[Line 2532] [Option Selected: "Tell me of your penance."]
"It is... trying," he says. "I am not, I am sure, meant to 'solve' this quest set before me to my violation of Knightly vows. Remorse, contrition... those I give freely, and wholly."
He speaks more quietly, "I speculate that my failure and disgrace is being arranged to humble the influence of the Reverend Archcurate Jaspis." He shakes his head, "She has put altogether too much faith into me."

[Line 2533] [Option Selected: "Now that I've agreed, I need to know of any potential factional conflicts."]
"A reasonable concern." Bornanew rubs his chin. "First and without doubt, a notable member of a Persean League gens is involved." 
"The rest are deduction and speculation." He starts counting off fingers, "The Cathedral of Holy Exodus has much to lose if corruption is revealed their house; I suspect an insider or an infiltrator."
Next finger, "Within the greater Church, there is a loosely organized sect who, ah, back the theological legitimacy of relics. They would doubtless have forceful opinions on the subject of a duplicate relic, and that in secular hands."

Another finger, "The Luddic Path has much to gain from discord within the Church, and they have proximity to... the problem."
Next finger, "Though it is possible that the criminal underworld has found a means of profit here, possibly Kanta's organization. The pirate queen has an especial taste for desecration, though has demonstrated no particular hatred for the Church beyond her habitual misanthropy." He lets his hands fall.
"Beyond that, I grasp for tenuous threads, captain."

[Line 2535] [Option Selected: "It sounds like you don't consider this object to be a legitimate holy relic."]
"Um. It is so obvious?" Bornanew almost looks guilty. Almost.
"The Reverend Archcurate did say that my feelings on the subject are... not easily veiled."
"This investigation requires discretion." He brings his hands together. "I shall be mindful of my disposition."

[Line 2536] [Option Selected: "I will take more time to consider your request, $global.jethroName."]
Bornanew puts his hands together, and lowers his head for a moment.

Bornanew looks almost surprised at your words. He does not pray, or thank Providence. He simply looks directly at you through the waver of the comm-link.
"Thank you, captain. Against all odds, you've cast a light upon my path toward redemption."
Perhaps apologetic for the moment of earnestness, he quickly adds, "I am prepared to leave when you are ready for me. I shall await word of your shuttle."

[Line 2555] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardingYarbStart:Continue]

[Line 2556] [Option Selected: Continue]
Novice Bornanew speaks from the head of the table on which he has placed a paper notebook. He seems disinclined to use the shared workspace of the holo visualization suite; you're not even sure he brought a datapad.
"...collector who now possesses this duplicate relic is a man by the name Menes Yaribay, a minor member of Gens Yaribay of Kazeron," he looks to you for a sign of recognition.

[Line 2557] Of course you know the Yaribays. You were given Horus Yaribay's diplomatic credentials to arrange a meeting with High Hegemon Daud.
Horus Yaribay might owe you a favor, depending on how he views the situation.

[Line 2557] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardingYarb2know:Explain this to $global.jethroName]

[Line 2558] Of course you know the Yaribays. You were given Horus Yaribay's diplomatic credentials to arrange a meeting with High Hegemon Daud and have, on at least one occasion, used those credentials to call a favor on account of Gens Yaribay's prestige.
Hopefully he didn't find out.

[Line 2558] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardingYarb2confess:Explain everything to $global.jethroName
BFFI_onBoardingYarb2noConfess:Explain, but leave out the abuse of credentials part]

[Line 2559] Of course you know the Yaribays. You were given Horus Yaribay's diplomatic credentials to arrange a meeting with High Hegemon Daud. During that meeting, you handed over the key required for an encrypted channel between Horus Yaribay and Baikal Daud.
Horus Yaribay might owe you a favor, depending on how he views the situation.

[Line 2559] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardingYarb2know:Explain this to $global.jethroName]

[Line 2560] You know of Gens Yaribay of Kazeron, one of the three dominant ruling family-corporations. Theirs is most inclined toward rapprochement with the Hegemony, focusing less on heavy military industry and more on interfactional ventures.

[Line 2560] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardingYarb2:"Yes, I've heard of the Yaribays."]

[Line 2561] [Option Selected: Explain everything to $global.jethroName]
Bornanew looks concerned as you describe your dealings. "Your conscience, your soul, is between you and- well, I am not your judge or confessor."
"From a practical standpoint, I would advise caution in asking too much of Horus of Gens Yaribay, to his face or behind it. He may know but choose not to act on your transgression."

[Line 2561] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardingYarb3:Continue]

[Line 2562] [Option Selected: Explain, but leave out the abuse of credentials part]
A brief look of concern crosses Bornanew's face, and he pauses as if composing an awkward question. He puts his hand back down on the table, seeming to dismiss the notion, and responds in a different tone.

[Line 2562] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardingYarb3:Continue]

[Line 2563] [Option Selected: Explain this to $global.jethroName]
"This is providential," he says, nodding. "Your previous dealings with Horus Yaribay could open an easier path to resolving the Church's problem."

[Line 2563] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardingYarb3:"My, uh, thoughts exactly."]

[Line 2564] [Option Selected: "Yes, I've heard of the Yaribays."]
He nods and proceeds.

[Line 2565] [Option Selected: "My, uh, thoughts exactly.";['BFFI_onBoardingYarb2']]
"The question, then, is how Horus Yaribay, the nominal gens leader, views Menes Yaribay's recent interest in religious artifacts."
Bornanew flips through his paper book, not really taking the time to read the dense notes therein. He runs a finger across lists of names.
"Not long ago Menes Yaribay was assigned the office of demarch, in essence the executive administrator, of Olinadu in the Kumari Kandam system. It is not a prestigious post. Olinadu is a small mining colony and the system is rife with Luddic Path activity. It is a dangerous, corrupt place."
Bornanew eye's return to you. "This is why I need your help."

[Line 2566] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardAskMenes:"You've done your research. Tell me about Menes Yaribay himself."]

[Line 2567] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardAskInCharge:"How did a Kazeron aristocrat get put in charge of Olinadu?"]

[Line 2568] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardAskRelic:"Tell me more about the relic at the center of this. What is it?"]

[Line 2569] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardAskTart4:"Wait, why's the real glove on Tartessus if Ludd removed it on Gilead?"]

[Line 2570] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardAskPlan:"What's the plan? Ask Menes nicely for the glove?"]

[Line 2572] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardAskChalcedon:"Kumari Kandam? You were on Chalcedon. With the Path."]

[Line 2573] [Option Selected: "Kumari Kandam? You were on Chalcedon. With the Path."]
"Indeed I was." He's steady. "You know of this. There I met Wrestling Sedge of the Luddic Path, and there I left my vows. For a time."
A pause. "You followed my path, and spoke with the man Sedge. He told you where I went from there, Mazalot, where you found me."

[Line 2574] "Indeed I was." He's steady as he speaks. "You know of this. There I met Wrestling Sedge of the Luddic Path, and there I left my vows. For a time."
A pause. "And you killed the man Sedge," he says. "The Path will have no love for you there, but I trust that you will be prepared for... that."

[Line 2575] [Option Selected: "You've done your research. Tell me about Menes Yaribay himself."]
"Certain tawdry media outlets in the outer League worlds and beyond report rumor and gossip about affairs, social vendettas, and... how shall I put this... decadent festivities undertaken by Menes. More so in his younger years, at least." Bornanew turns pages in his notebook, not reading, but recalling as he goes through the motions with his hands.
"His enthusiasm for such pursuits has waned from the cycles of his youth, and his interests have shifted. At heart, I suspect Menes is still a man who wishes for all to hear his name, and for all who hear it to be very impressed."

[Line 2575] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardAskMenes2:Continue]

[Line 2576] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Unfortunately for his ambition, he is a natural dilettante in all pursuits. He avoids challenge, seeking instead flattery and the appearance of success which may be purchased with credits." Bornanew reports this without obvious outward judgment, as if discussing the results of a gravimetric survey.
"To his gens, Menes has given only scandal and debt. I suspect he was placed in the Olinadu administration to limit his ability to further damage their reputation."
Bornanew smiles grimly now. "It is some irony that he has potentially stumbled into more trouble than ever."

[Line 2577] [Option Selected: "How did a Kazeron aristocrat get put in charge of Olinadu?"]
"Gens Yaribay has a controlling interest in the military corporation which exercises the monopoly of violence for the polity of Olinadu. The Pathers are an ever-present threat, so those who don't cooperate... well, that is the stick which compels. The carrot, on the other hand, is a stream of investment credits facilitated by Gens Yaribay brokers."
"The locals cooperate with this arrangement, and agreed to vote Menes Yaribay to an executive position, perhaps understanding that he'd play the role as a figurehead rather than a serious administrator. Olinadu receives investment and safety while, from all accounts, Menes Yaribay simply wants to be liked."
"Compared to the alternatives," says Bornanew, "he is an ideal overlord."

[Line 2578] [Option Selected: "Tell me more about the relic at the center of this. What is it?"]
"Yes, the... artifact." Bornanew looks down, clasping his hands together, then taking them apart and setting them deliberately on the table.
"Ludd's right-hand glove," an abashed smile appears.
"A standard work-glove of Domain manufacture. Light vac-suit compatible. The story is that Ludd removed it to touch the ground of Gilead."

[Line 2578] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardAskRelic1a:"And you don't think it's real? The original, I mean."
BFFI_onBoardAskRelic1b:"Seems like a lot to get worked up about."
BFFI_onBoardAskRelic1c:"What's Ludd going to do with two right-hand gloves?"]

[Line 2579] [Option Selected: "And you don't think it's real? The original, I mean."]
"It's a real glove," he says, "That much is true."
"It's just a work glove, one of many designs prevalent through the immediate pre- and post-Collapse Persean Sector."

[Line 2580] [Option Selected: "Seems like a lot to get worked up about."]
"I think," he begins, "it is a matter of seeking a physical connection with the sacred."

[Line 2581] [Option Selected: "What's Ludd going to do with two right-hand gloves?"]
Bornanew laughs. "Yes, exactly."

[Line 2582] Option(s) Selected: ['BFFI_onBoardAskRelic1a'];['BFFI_onBoardAskRelic1b'];['BFFI_onBoardAskRelic1c']
"My objection is that the glove, even if it is the glove, is not important. What is important is Ludd's message, Ludd's sacrifice; it is the act of a divine moral force touching the soul of humanity with supreme grace."

[Line 2582] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardAskRelic3:Continue]

[Line 2583] [Option Selected: Continue]
"What is a glove to the light of Revelation?" The words come out forcefully.
"Even if it were Ludd's glove - and that we can't, and should not, be sure of - would God love you more for possessing it? Touching, looking upon, and worshipping it?"
His brow furrows. "Then some would try to extract DNA from the glove. Clone Ludd, they say, to re-open a connection to God." He shakes his head furiously, "As if you could fool God with the twin of the prophet's body!"
"Or the glove that body might have worn."

[Line 2583] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardAskRelic4:Continue]

[Line 2584] [Option Selected: Continue]
"It's the fool's logic of 'magic' of the lowest kind, the heretical notion that humanity might manipulate the Divine to our own ends. Creation turned on its head!"
You've never seen Bornanew like this, his voice like a river; his physical size giving power to his words. Seeing you see this, he realizes it himself.
"I apologize for my outburst, captain," he says, looking down.

[Line 2584] [Options Given: BFFI_onBoardAskRelic5a:"Let's try to focus on the matter, ah, at hand."
BFFI_onBoardAskRelic5b:"No need to apologize. I can't help but agree."
bffi_onBoardAskRelic5d:"But magic isn't real. So what harm is focusing on a glove, fake relic or not?"]

[Line 2585] [Option Selected: "Let's try to focus on the matter, ah, at hand."]
He nods, suppressing a smile, looking down at his notebook. He puts his hands together again.

[Line 2586] [Option Selected: "No need to apologize. I can't help but agree."]
He meets your gaze. "I shall interpret your words as forgiveness. It is nonetheless unseemly for a Knight to let uncontrolled passion rule their actions."

[Line 2588] [Option Selected: "But magic isn't real. So what harm is focusing on a glove, fake relic or not?"]
"Of course, of course." He rubs his chin, calmer now.
"The problem is not that it might work, but that such self-trickery will lead the Faithful astray from the Word. And if we don't follow the Word, then what use have we for revelation? Are we to simply discard God's gifts?"
He sits, looking into the distance somewhere. "Ludd chose the revealed path not because it was easy, and not because it was without suffering. Ludd chose because it was Good."

[Line 2588] [Options Given: bffi_onBoardAskRelic5dCotton:"I've heard those words before. From Brother Cotton."
bffi_onBoardAskRelic5e:Continue]

He glances at you with a fleeting grimace of self-reflection.
"With further apology for the ramble through theology, captain; the matter of the false relic should be our focus."

[Line 2591] Mention of Cotton dims Bornanew's expression. "He's read the Word, too, of course. In his way."
He sighs, deeply. "Let his crimes, worldly and spiritual, serve as bloody warning of the path those... that those uncertain of their faith might be compelled to follow. I pray it weren't so."
"Which, with apologies for the ramble through theology, brings us back to the false relic."

[Line 2592] [Option Selected: "Wait, why's the real glove on Tartessus if Ludd removed it on Gilead?"]
Bornanew gives you a look.
"It's a tedious story. And unimportant."

[Line 2593] [Option Selected: "What's the plan? Ask Menes nicely for the glove?"]
Bornanew closes his book of notes.
"It has been made clear to me that the Church would like this problem, this false idol, to quietly disappear," he says. "It can only tear open old rifts within the Church which would weaken the resolve of the Faithful. It would turn walker against walker in troubling times which promise naught but more trouble."
"I am prepared to ask nicely, but I do not believe Menes will agree to give someone like myself his glove."

"Yes," he says with the hint of a smile.

"Interesting." Bornanew rubs his chin. "If you believe Horus will be receptive to you bearing this... news. I wonder if it may be as simple as that."

[Line 2597] [Option Selected: "We could steal it."]
"It is... yes, that is possible," he says begrudgingly. "I would like to know more before we act, however. I pray this may prove simpler than could be hoped."

"You could." Bornanew emphasizes 'you'. "The Church refuses to acknowledge the false relic."

He stands for a moment, eyes closed. "It is not ideal," he says.

"Indeed!" Menes says, perking up. "In truth, I consider myself something of an antiquarian. It provides me with a... a connection to the great individuals who have come before and changed the worlds for," he pauses for drama, "...good or ill."

[Line 2626] [Option Selected: Continue]
Bornanew's head is lowered as he enters, carrying his paper notebook as well as an off-brand datapad.
The notebook slaps onto the table a little harder than would be considered strictly polite.

[Line 2627] "-I'd hardly describe myself as a 'hardened' criminal, and although technically a Knight of Ludd, I'm merely a novice - and one in poor standing at that."

[Line 2628] "I think it is uncharitable to the point of slander to describe the people of Mazalot as 'terrorists' so easily. And although it was a remote farming community, I was hardly hermit, to say nothing of-" He stops mid-rebuttal and looks up.

[Line 2629] "Although technically a Knight of Ludd, I'm merely a novice - and one in poor standing at that. As for this 'epic quest' you describe, it's more of-" He stops speaking and looks up at you.

"Yes," he sighs. "A barefaced ruse, I understand."

"Yes," he sighs. "I shall hold that thought as dearest comfort."

[Line 2644] Bornanew nods, putting his hand back on his book as if drawing knowledge from it.
OR
"Of course, captain," Bornanew says.
OR
Bornanew looks down at his notebook and turns a page, then turns it back. "Of course, yes."

[Line 2645] [Option Selected: "Let's discuss inviting Horus Yaribay to this party."]
Bornanew looks at you for a long moment.
"Do you think Horus Yaribay will help?"

[Line 2645] [Options Given: bffi_mmBornOptHorusInvite1:"He wants to appease the Hegemony. And Luddics are a significant demographic..."]

[Line 2646] [Option Selected: "He wants to appease the Hegemony. And Luddics are a significant demographic..."]
He nods as you lay out your reasoning. The Hegemony wants a stable Luddic population. Horus wants a stable Hegemony in order to negotiate a peaceful settlement.
"If Horus intervenes to defuse the situation before a greater conflict is fomented... Horus the peace-maker..." Bornanew drums his fingers on his notebook.
"Which is exactly what he wants to be, if what you say is true. This could be over quickly. And quietly." He closes his eyes and holds his hands together as if saying a quiet prayer.

[Line 2646] [Options Given: BFFI_mmBornDoInviteHorus:"Then it's decided. I'll speak with Horus first."
bffi_mmBornOptsBack:"Let's discuss other options."]

[Line 2647] [Option Selected: "Let's discuss inviting Horus Yaribay to this party."]
"If you can persuade Horus to intervene in the situation before it gets out of hand-" Bornanew sighs loudly, catching himself. "Forgive my choice of word; jocularity is not my intent."
He begins again, "If Horus sees it in his interest to force Menes to surrender the glove - and its source - then all might be resolved peaceably."

[Line 2647] [Options Given: BFFI_mmBornDoInviteHorus:"Then it's decided. I'll speak with Horus first."
bffi_mmBornOptsBack:"Let's discuss other options."]

[Line 2648] [Option Selected: "Let's discuss the heist option again."]
You can tell he doesn't like the idea.
"That seems... it would be a blunt approach," he says. "And risky."

[Line 2648] [Options Given: bffi_mmBornOptSteal2a:"I often find the direct approach the most effective."
bffi_mmBornOptSteal2b:"Don't tell me you've never stolen before, $global.jethroName."
]

[Line 2649] [Option Selected: "I often find the direct approach the most effective."]
He looks at you, and you see that he knows he has no argument for you.
Bornanew sighs. "Nonetheless, theft is a sin. And I did swear a sacred oath that I would never steal again."

[Line 2649] [Options Given: BFFI_meetMenesBornOptSteal3:"Then I'll steal it. You can just show up and be yourself."]

[Line 2650] [Option Selected: "Don't tell me you've never stolen before, $global.jethroName."]
"Yes, I- That's not-"
He exhales sharply. "Not only is theft a sin. I did also swear a sacred oath that I would never steal again."

[Line 2650] [Options Given: BFFI_meetMenesBornOptSteal3:"Then I'll steal it. You can just show up and be yourself."]

[Line 2651] [Option Selected: "Then I'll steal it. You can just show up and be yourself."]
"But I, I-" he stutters to a halt. "I suppose, in the strictest sense this is... captain, I do not like it. Is there no alternative?"

[Line 2651] [Options Given: BFFI_meetMenesBornOptSteal4a:"No one gets hurt. And it's a fake which they stole from your people in the first place."
BFFI_meetMenesBornOptSteal4b:"I could send a marine raid in to steal it so we don't have to."
BFFI_meetMenesBornOptSteal4c:"I could threaten to bombard the planet until Menes surrenders the relic."
BFFI_meetMenesBornOptSteal4d:"Fine. Let's think of something else."]

[Line 2652] [Option Selected: "No one gets hurt. And it's a fake which they stole from your people in the first place."]
Bornanew nods, still looking displeased.

[Line 2653] [Option Selected: "I could send a marine raid in to steal it so we don't have to."]
Bornanew gives you a distraught look.

[Line 2654] [Option Selected: "I could threaten to bombard the planet until Menes surrenders the relic."]
Bornanew gives you a distraught look.
"I pray that is merely a joke in poor taste."

[Line 2655] [Option Selected: "Fine. Let's think of something else."]
Bornanew nods, still looking a bit as though he's eaten something foul.

[Line 2660] [Option Selected: "Let's discuss me posing as a buyer again."]
"Well. Menes likes you," he says. "He likes people who are rich and exciting, and important. He wants you to like him. He wants to be associated with people who are like what he imagines you are."
"Offering to buy his 'relic'... he would like that, I think."

"To what end? We want Menes to reveal from whom he acquired the duplicate." He taps his notebook, thinking. Then looks back at you.
"What if you were a buyer."

[Line 2661] [Options Given: bffi_mmBornBuyerOpt2:"What if I was?"]

[Line 2662] [Option Selected: "What if I was?"]
"Menes likes you," he says. "He likes people who are rich and exciting. He wants you to like him. I suspect he could be persuaded to reveal his source. Or, if not, we could discover it if we had possession of the false relic..."

bffi_mmBornArroyoB:"Absolutely not."
bffi_mmBornArroyoC:"No."

"I see," he says. "Perhaps we should consider a different option."

[Line 2682] [Option Selected: "If the Church isn't paying... you're asking me to pay."]
You can see the inner conflict on Bornanew's face.
He knows he is asking far, far too much. But he wants to. If he had the credits, he would give them to the cause of the Church without a second thought. But he is a Knight of Ludd, sworn to poverty but for the allowance granted to him by his order - or by the indulgence of the Reverend Archcurate Jaspis.
He sees that you see all of this. And, knowing that words can only do harm, he makes the barest movement toward a shrug. A way of saying, you know who I am; what I am; what I need ask. Your choice is yours.

[Line 2683] [Option Selected: "I am not exactly overflowing with credits at the moment."]
"That is a problem," Bornanew admits.
"I don't believe Menes will take an offer seriously unless you demonstrate that you possess immense wealth. A half million credits, at least. To be safe." He taps his book, "Though if you could talk him into accepting payment in the form of installments, you'd only have to pay a fraction of the full price to take possession of the glove..."

[Line 2684] [Option Selected: "I may be rich, but you intend to destroy the glove, right?"]
"Yes," Bornanew admits.
"I don't believe Menes will take an offer seriously unless you can demonstrate that you possess immense wealth. A half million credits, at least. To be safe." He taps his book, "Though if you could talk him into accepting payment in the form of installments, you might only have to pay a fraction of the full price to take possession..."

[Line 2685] [Option Selected: "I may not have credits, but I do operate an independent colony..."]
"That's true," Bornanew says. "You might be able to talk Menes into accepting payment in the form of smaller installments. Then if we can resolve the entire matter of the glove quickly, perhaps you would only have to pay the initial deposit..."

[Line 2686] [Option Selected: "I may not have credits, but I am a member of the Persean League..."]
"An excellent point," Bornanew says, looking hopeful.
"This gives you exceptional credibility with Menes -- after all, you're a fellow demarch! I would wonder if you couldn't defer payment entirely, or convince him to accept a small percentage as a deposit to be paid later. And then if we resolve the matter of the glove quickly..."

[Line 2687] [Option Selected: "Are you... proposing that I cheat Menes Yaribay?"]
"I'm, uh..." Bornanew turns red.
"I... in the due course of investigation... if - no, not if - when we prove that the glove is a fake we demonstrate that the deal was made on invalid terms. But we need to glove first for physical evidence. It's... yes, it does involve a conscious deception... please don't look at me like that, captain," he says, almost indignant.
"It doesn't involve any killing, at least. I do pray it won't come to that."

[Line 2690] [Option Selected: "I too." (lie)]
He presses his hands together, though gives you a brief, suspicious look.

[Line 2691] [Option Selected: "Let's discuss me posing as a buyer again."]

[Line 2692] [Option Selected: "I'll simply send my marines in to seize the relic."]
"Captain, I must remind you that an interfactional incident must be avoided." He says this more evenly than you might have expected.
Bornanew looks down at this notebook, then up, "And I myself pray," he says in a low and quiet voice, "that I might avoid the shedding of innocent blood in this, this which is meant to be part of my act of penance."

"Nonetheless, if you insist, then I shall be forced to concede," Bornanew says.
"If we... if you can execute a raid; if you can do it without implicating the Church; if seizing this fake relic quickly and quietly will lead us to its maker and thereafter to a swift conclusion of the whole matter... then maybe the Church can avoid schism and disaster."

[Line 2702] [Option Selected: "It's decided. I'll steal that glove."]
Sometimes acquiring something is as simple as taking it.
Both you and Bornanew - who is unenthusiastic, but professional throughout - are outfitted with an inconspicuous set of tools: a sheet-diamond rated cutter, EM glitcher, lockbreakers.
Bornanew sets aside some of the bulkier accoutrement with a shake of his head.

Your tech officer installs a schematic of Menes' complex and a suite of scramblers on your datapad, a remote interfacer is hidden inside a fashionable stylus.
You perform the operation of various gadgets with your armorer, and review the choreography of the heist with your tactical officer. It is not a perfect plan, but with a combination of initiative, redundancy, and exceptional access...
Bornanew is standing very still, his fist against his jaw.

[Line 2703] [Options Given: bffi_mmBornDoSteal3:"Yes? What is it?"]

[Line 2704] [Option Selected: "Yes? What is it?"]

"Why should Menes leave you alone with the relic, or at all?" He looks over at you.

[Line 2713] [Option Selected: "I, too, have my faith. Is that nothing?"]
"Pray forgive me, captain; I do no question your faith." He presses his hands together.
"But Menes Yaribay cannot see into your soul. He will see your uniform, and my robes. That will be enough."

"We attend Menes' party. Be interesting. Be yourself. Get Menes to show off the glove."

He crosses his arms. "I am not."

BFFI mm do raid outro
------------------------------
[Line 2717] [Option Selected: "It is necessary. I shall make the arrangements."]
Bornanew bows his head to your words. His expression is grim.
Menes has not been discreet. As a celebration of his first cycle as the new demarch of Olinadu, he invited a holodoc team for a puff-piece interview and viewing of his 'collection'. Your tactical team reviews the holos, constructing schematic of the interior of Menes' complex, inferring layout and defenses from this and other publicly available information.

[Line 2717] [Options Given: bffi_mmBornDoRaid2:Continue]

[Line 2718] [Option Selected: Continue]
It is estimated that roughly 100 marines will be required to pull off the operation.
Your marines will be equipped with an eclectic mix of equipment to allow them to pose as high-level pirates. They will be secretly infiltrated into Olinadu as, variously, spacer crew on shore-leave, contract technicians, and ne'er-do-wells looking to spend ill-gotten gains somewhere away from heavy law enforcement.
It goes without saying that you shall need to approach Olinadu with your $shipOrFleet's transponder off. Menes' overly charitable outlook on your character and generalized inattention to his official duties should allow you to join his 'party' with little oversight about how you actually got there.

[Line 2718] [Options Given: bffi_mmBornDoRaid3:Continue]

[Line 2719] [Option Selected: Continue]
To avert suspicion and ensure optimal timing, you and Bornanew will personally attend Menes' party when the raid is executed.
The raid will commence when two of a series of randomly generated time-slots are passed without receiving a stand-down signal. This signal will be, by all appearances, a routine status query to your $shipOrFleet, and appear to be perfectly routine behaviour for a justifiably neurotic independent $shipOrFleet operator.
Bornanew is watchful throughout the planning process, only occasionally advocating for lower-force protocols when a particularly bloodthirsty marine squad leader expresses more enthusiasm than strictly required for certain tactical details.

Later, in the briefing room, you find Bornanew standing over a detailed schematic of Menes' complex. It rotates slowly in the shared display volume, gradually shadowing and illuminating his face.
It takes a moment, but you see that his eyes are closed and his lips are moving.
A prayer, you suspect.

[Line 2732] [Option Selected: "He might spark a religious conflict that could tear the Sector apart."]
Horus blinks, and turns his head aside as if he didn't hear you correctly. His eyes snap back to yours through the comm-link.
"Elaborate upon your statement, if you would be so kind."
A harsh note enters his tone, despite ostensibly polite words.

[Line 2733] [Option Selected: "He bought a sacred Luddic relic for his personal collection."]
Horus takes this in, looking into the middle distance, processing for a moment. He takes a slow breath.
"You are certain? Do the Luddics know about it?"

[Line 2733] [Options Given: bffi_talkHorusPartyTheyKnow:"Oh, they know. They hired me to... handle it."]

"He is family." Horus gives you a flinty look. "State your meaning."

[Line 2735] [Option Selected: "Oh, they know. They hired me to... handle it."]
He closes his eyes and rubs his temples. After a moment, a mutter emerges, "Good grief."
He takes several more long breaths.

"I shall make my own way to Olinadu, thank you. Have your people coordinate with my people."

[Line 2746] [Option Selected: Accept Menes Yaribay's invitation and shuttle to his complex]
Menes' invitation provides you with a flight path and Demarch-level traffic control override codes.
It's probably a violation of Persean League ethical guidelines for you to be using these to attend a personal party, but from what you can overhear of the pilot's comms, the locals have a casual attitude toward the arrangement.

[Line 2746] [Options Given: bffi_attendPartyIntro2:Continue]

[Line 2747] [Option Selected: Accept Menes Yaribay's invitation and shuttle to his complex]
You and Bornanew make an 'undocumented' arrival on Olinadu then transfer to a private shuttle service in order to attend Menes' party.
Your hired pilot gives a shrug as she shows you a flight path blocked out with red DENIED tags - until you apply the key attached to your invitation, which turns out to be a Demarch-level override code.
It's probably a violation of Persean League ethical guidelines for you to be using these to attend a personal party, but the pilot simply smiles and proceeds. This sort of thing isn't unusual under Menes' administration, it appears.

[Line 2747] [Options Given: bffi_attendPartyIntro2:Continue]

[Line 2748] [Option Selected: Continue]
Menes Yaribay's compound is a scrubbed-looking slab of trendy architecture set on a bluff overlooking Olinadu's primary habitation cluster.
A smattering of outbuildings and hangars, attached by fat trunks of conduit and glowing walktubes, sprawl across the less-fashionable view-angles of the compound toward the refineries and holding tanks of the planet's industrial center.

[Line 2748] [Options Given: bffi_attendPartyIntro3:Continue]

[Line 2749] [Option Selected: Continue]
One set of hangar bay doors dutifully open, and your shuttle descends through the glowing atmo-field. Such gadgetry is an ostentatious addition to a personal residence, but it avoids the bother of visitors (and their shuttles) having to undergo pressure-cycling.
An enthusiastic Menes is already approaching your shuttle's access ramp as it sets itself down and signals the all-clear.
Bornanew exchanges a look with you, then rises to disembark.

[Line 2750] [Option Selected: Meet Menes Yaribay]
"Captain $playerName," Menes crosses his chest with one arm, hand on heart, the other held behind, giving a small bow. "Allow me to welcome you to my home."
"And you've brought your fascinating friend!" he exclaims, as if it was a surprise. "This must be...?"

Bornanew nods, not quite a bow, with his hands held together. Perhaps to avoid Menes' much-ringed hands from grabbing his. You are not so lucky, and must endure an overlong handshake.
Menes is delighted at all of this, eyes flashing with something akin to greed.

[Line 2753] [Options Given: BFFI_attendPartyHub1Intro1:Continue]

[Line 2754] [Option Selected: Continue]
Menes leads you past gilded statues posed to guard the portal to the main complex; the forms are evocative of splashes of molten gold frozen by happenstance into sensual humanoid figures.
You endure a rolling barrage of patter from Menes about the expense of renovations, the acquisition of artworks, the exclusivity of access to particular artists and engineering firms who have contributed to his home, his manor, and its collection.
Occasionally a robotic or human servitor appears to offer drinks or nibbles, and you've a growing feeling that Menes has picked up a glass from one only to place it back on the tray of another without ever taking a sip between the two.
A fresh glass in hand, delicate amber liquid fizzing away, Menes leads you into what can only be his prize entertaining space.

[Line 2754] [Options Given: BFFI_attendPartyHub1Intro2:Continue]

[Line 2755] [Option Selected: Continue]
The space is at once cavernous and intimate; the sightlines and carved, wrought, and woven details calculated to replicate the appearance of cozy warmth like the den of some thoughtful patron of art, history, and literature.
A double handful of well-dressed remoras mill about, interrupting their conversations to smile and lift a glass as Menes enters. They look to be a collection of industrialists, financiers, distant gens-relatives, and at least one officer from atop the local military detachment who appears a little worse for his drink. Most nod to you and Bornanew, eyes not lingering to the point of impoliteness.
One skinny man in a finely embroidered suit has no such compunction, and rushes to greet your party, eyes agog at the newest additions to Menes' collection.

[Line 2756] [Option Selected: Continue]
He nearly trips over himself to speak. "The great Captain $playerName! If half of what Menes has said is true... why, half the Sector must tremble at the appearance of your $shipOrFleet!"
"We'll have to ask Navarch Atreus over there what he thinks of your combat record," the man grins wickedly, "If he hasn't had too many of these, of course; with all thanks to our kind host, a true gentleman and scholar." He lifts his glass approvingly at Menes, and you see his eyes slide toward Bornanew.
"And Jethro Bornanew, I believe? A Knight of Ludd?"

Bornanew forces out the equivalent of a smile.
"Of course, captain." He turns to the man. "Pray forgive me, sir, my forgotten manners," he says.

[Line 2760] [Option Selected: "Pleased to meet you...?";['bffi_attendPartyHub1Intro5b']]
Menes laughs heartily.
"Let me introduce Ulmus Pond," he says. "Now he'll claim to be a mere commodities trader," Menes winks as if you are in on a shared joke, "but I daresay he knows everyone of any importance in the Kumari Kandam system. And if you need anything." He lowers his voice, "Anything at all. He's your man."
Pond, grinning widely, makes a brushing-off gesture as if to dismiss Menes' words - but not so assertively as to deny them.

Pond grins wider, and begins to speak. "The feeling, I'm sure-"

[Line 2768] [Option Selected: "Everyone, you say? Does that include the Luddic Path?"]
Pond laughs too loudly. "Dear Menes, where did you find such a fantastic character? Without you, I'm certain we'd all die of boredom out here."

[Line 2769] [Option Selected: "So, Ulmus was it? How do you know $global.jethroName?"]
Pond laughs a little too loudly. "Of course we've just met, but dear Menes spoke of a Knight from some unseemly background, and it's a tale which can't but seize the imagination, am I wrong?"

[Line 2770] [Option Selected: "Anything, you say? We'll have to talk later, Mister Pond."]
Pond's grin widens. "My thoughts are the same, and you know what they say about great-"

Pond's grin hardens ever so slightly. "I'm sure I'd be delighted to speak more later about-"

Menes slaps a hand on Pond's shoulder, causing him to nearly spill his drink.
"Ulmus, Ulmus! You'll have plenty of time to speak with the good captain later. I did promise a surprise, a private showing for $playerHimOrHer and $playerHisOrHer noble Knight. You might know the piece, my friend," he winks again, this time to Pond.
"Come along, come along!" Menes says, grabbing your arm. Ulmus Pond's eyes follow you, fawning oozingly.

Menes leads you and Bornanew to his inner sanctum, flashing a grin as he operates a series of obtrusive biometric checks.
The air cools by a degree, perhaps two, the armored mass of the walls felt as a dullness through your feet. The subdued lighting, drapery, and framing of the space suggest the interior of a bank vault or a shrine, though not to the praise of any Luddic virtue.
Quite the contrary, depending on one's outlook.

On a pedestal of carved wood, in a spot of light like holy revelation, a single glove is upthrust. It's fingers appear frozen in the midst of just starting to curl back toward a relaxed state after giving you a little wave.

[Line 2777] [Options Given: bffi_mpSteal3:Continue]

[Line 2778] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Do you know what this is?" Menes whispers to you. 
"The Right-Hand Glove of Blessed Ludd," Bornanew answers, stepping forward, voice filled with trembling reverence.
"Removed by the Blessed Ludd, whereupon that prophet fell to the sacred Earth of Gilead to kiss that holy ground. Blessings be upon Ludd; Good is the Word; By the Holy Pneuma; By the Divine Light which illuminates the righteous Path through the Garden of Temptation..."

Bornanew himself falls to his knees, half-whispering, half-sobbing in prayer, rocking back and forth, his eyes wide and focus vague. 
This is a display you have never seen from $global.jethroName, completely at odds with his usual air of reserve.
Menes steps back with you, looking somehow appalled and delighted at the same time. He stares at Bornanew like a voyeur.

"Yes, yes," he replies under his breath.

[Line 2781] [Option Selected: Wait a bit;['bffi_mpSteal5']]
Bornanew keeps at it, absolutely rapt upon his prayer toward the glove, tears and phlegm running down his face. It is, truly, a pathetic and uncomfortably intimate sight.
Menes keeps staring, an open half-smile on his lips.

[Line 2783] [Option Selected: Gently pull Menes' away and ask about other items in the collection]
It takes a slightly more than polite tug to overcome Menes' inertia, but finally he's dislodged from Bornanew's spectacle toward another of the handful of chambers making up this 'inner sanctum'.
Menes keeps glancing back toward Bornanew as he explains the story of one or another object: A captain's uniform of the Fourteenth Battlegroup, sword and all, from the period of the Cold Passage; a bottle of spirits from some core Domain star system near Old Earth; a pistol once owned by the Warlord Leonis; the crystalline xenocoral of a species extinct for half a billion years collected by the Exploraria.

He rambles, and you make a good show of asking for additional details, drawing his attention toward the object at hand and away from whatever in Ludd's name Bornanew is doing.
A piercing alarm interrupts Menes mid-thought. His eyes go wide and snap toward the central atrium which holds the glove- and Bornanew. He takes off at a run.

[Line 2788] [Options Given: bffi_mpSteal11:Follow Menes]

[Line 2789] [Option Selected: Follow Menes]
You both find Bornanew, still on his knees, with one hand stretched out to touch the glove - one finger upon it - lips still moving, eyes still blankly huge as if overcome by religious mania.
Menes gives out a wordless cry of alarm, and begins lifting his cuff to call security.
Your off-hand instinctively curls around a control interface for one of the clever little thieves-tools you have hidden about your uniform.

[Line 2789] [Options Given: bffi_mpSteal12a:"$global.jethroName! Restrain yourself, man!"
bffi_mpSteal12b:"He's only touched it, no need for-"]

[Line 2791] [Option Selected: "He's only touched it, no need for-";['bffi_mpSteal12a']]
Menes hesitates as you speak, then barks a codeword into his comms.
You freeze, understanding what this sort of protocol looks like. The lights flare into harsh illumination and a trio of gun turrets pop from subtle cupolas - one each tracks instantly to you and Bornanew while the third spins in a slow covering pattern.
The human guards arrive a moment later, uniforms bright-white, boots squeaking on the floor. Menes breathes heavily, watching the security net tighten.
Bornanew, meanwhile, has not moved but to turn his head toward you and Menes.

[Line 2791] [Options Given: bffi_mpSteal13:Continue]

[Line 2792] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Menes, Yaribay sir. I pray your forgiveness. I- I was overcome by... I had to..." Bornanew trails off, pathetically.

bffi_mpSteal14b:(whisper) "This'll make a great story."]

[Line 2794] [Option Selected: Say nothing]
It takes a second, but Menes starts to laugh.
And laugh, and laugh deep in his belly, almost a shout. He suddenly throws an arm over your shoulder, putting you off balance, as he struggles to contain himself.

[Line 2794] [Options Given: bffi_mpSteal15:Try to remain standing]

[Line 2795] [Option Selected: Try to remain standing]
"You're right!" he shouts, "Captain, by the stars, you are right."

[Line 2796] [Option Selected: Try to remain standing]
"You there," Menes calls out, "Knight $global.jethroName, get yourself off the floor. Come wash your face, you look absolutely disgusting. Back to the party! Drinks are on me, ha-ha!"
As almost an afterthought he calls to the security team, "You lot, clean this up and get out of here... ruining the mood."

[Line 2796] [Options Given: bffi_mpSteal16:Continue]

[Line 2797] [Option Selected: Continue]
You and Bornanew, he given a basin and washcloth by a servitor, are hauled back into the party, and the entire crowd regaled with the story of Bornanew being overcome with awe at the relic and then caught setting off the security alarm.
Menes seems to find it more hilarious with every telling - and each additional round of drinks. His dutiful entourage joins in the laughter each time. The skinny man, Ulmus Pond, has a particularly manic, piercing laugh.
It is some time before you are able to get a quiet word in with $global.jethroName.

[Line 2798] [Option Selected: "What in Ludd's seven hells was that?"]
"I beg pardon for your blasphemy, captain," Bornanew says with a hint of strain in his voice. "Ludd's conception of hell was, so much as the Word reveals, a description of mortal torment in a Domain without God."
"But I do have the glove. What remains is-" an almost malicious smile briefly appears, "a fake."

[Line 2799] [Option Selected: "What went wrong?"]
"Little, but for the monotony of my humiliation, however justly earned," Bornanew says with a hint of strain in his voice. "But I do have the glove. What remains is a-" an almost malicious smile very briefly appears, "fake."

bffi_mpSteal18c:"... Praise Ludd."]

[Line 2804] [Option Selected: "You had a fake glove? This whole time?"]
His eyes keep watch on Menes as he replies.
"It's just a glove, captain. The color matches. I didn't think Menes would notice." His mouth quirks. "He didn't."
"He will notice eventually, however. We should... become distant from this place."

It is a feat of diplomacy that you manage to extract yourself and Bornanew as quickly as you are able.
A faked containment failure alert from your chief engineer merely opens the door. Passing through requires shaking everyone's hand, exchanging pleasant words, and going through the motions of good-byes several times over - then each time the ritual is interrupted by some tangent or anecdote from Menes, he ensures that it is begun again from the start.

BFFI buyer sequence during Menes party
------------------------------
[Line 2808] [Option Selected: Enter the vault]
On a pedestal of carved wood, in a spot of light like holy revelation, a single glove is upthrust. It's fingers appear frozen in the midst of just starting to curl back toward a relaxed state after giving you a little wave.

[Line 2808] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyer0:Continue]

[Line 2809] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Do you know what this is?" Menes whispers to you. 
"It looks like a glove, demarch," Bornanew answers in feigned misunderstanding, stepping forward.

[Line 2809] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyer1:Continue]

[Line 2810] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Not any glove," Menes says with more than a hint of vexation.
He begins again in a reverent whisper, "The glove worn by Ludd upon stepping upon the sacred Earth of Gilead. Ludd removed the glove and kissed the ground, according to the Luddic religion. Isn't that right, sir Knight? And this... is it."
Bornanew looks at you, his eyebrows rising slightly as if to give a cue. "This would be a most impressive find," he says. "If it is as you say."

[Line 2810] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyer2:"Well I'm impressed, Menes. A relic from a pivotal moment of the Sector's history!"]

[Line 2811] [Option Selected: "Well I'm impressed, Menes. A relic from a pivotal moment of the Sector's history!"]
"Thank-you captain!" Menes says, relieved and more than a little pleased that someone appreciates his trinket.
"Setting aside its purely religious significance," he gives an annoyed glance at Bornanew, "it represents a, a heralding of the changing tide of history! The ebbing influence of the Domain-era megacorporations, the rising of what some call - not my words of course, sir Knight - an atavistic populism. Truly, it is this small piece of the vastness of the story of Humanity which called to me when it was first described to me..."

[Line 2811] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyer3:"I, too, feel its call. Would you consider selling the piece?"]

[Line 2812] [Option Selected: "I, too, feel its call. Would you consider selling the piece?"]
"Oh, captain." Menes chuckles approvingly. "I couldn't possibly sell this, the prize of my collection. Nothing can compare!"
"-Although," he quibbles with himself, "I do possess a captain's uniform of the Fourteenth Battlegroup in excellent condition, and indeed a pistol once owned by the Warlord Leonis which I believe was used to execute prisoners at... well, you understand my point of course."

[Line 2812] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyer3b:Continue]

[Line 2813] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Of course," Bornanew says from behind Menes, who has fully turned his back to the Knight. "If it is indeed the real glove of Ludd."
You maintain your composure while watching the look that crosses Menes' face.

[Line 2813] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyer4:"The Knight has a point, Menes. I couldn't make an offer without verification."]

[Line 2814] [Option Selected: "The Knight has a point, Menes. I couldn't make an offer without verification."]
Menes laugh is more than a little strained.
"Now now, captain, I have not said I was offering the glove for any kind of sale. And," he glances back at Bornanew, "a lesser man than I might take offense at your implications, sir. My source has impeccable standards, and I assure you the provenance of the piece is most distinguished."

[Line 2815] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerVeracity:"Let's discuss veracity. I need... reassurance." ]

[Line 2816] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerVeracity:"Considering my offer, I require full confidence in the item."]

[Line 2819] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerCredits1m:"Let's not waste time. One million credits."]

[Line 2820] [Option Selected: "Considering my offer, I require full confidence in the item."]
"Veracity?" An annoyed look crosses Menes face.
"I have nothing to prove; the good name of Yaribay speaks for itself. Besides, we are not even discussing a sale."

[Line 2821] [Option Selected: "Considering my offer, I require full confidence in the item."]
"Veracity. Hmm." Menes doesn't look pleased, but he doesn't look as annoyed as before.

[Line 2822] [Option Selected: "Let's not waste time. One million credits."]
"One million credits." Menes can't help but allow a glowing smile to break across his face.

[Line 2823] Option(s) Selected: ['bffi_mpBuyerVeracity', '$madeOffer']
"I can see you are a practical dealer. Skeptical, even," he says. "This is understandable in a spacer. I know well of the sorts of figures you must deal with- corrupt Hegemony officers, pirates, ... treacherous, blood-thirsty Pather fanatics," he gives a quick glance at Bornanew to see if he's pierced the Knight's shell.
$global.jethroName is serenely pondering the glove, only half-listening by all appearances.

[Line 2824] [Option Selected: "Let's discuss credits. Would a half-million open the question of a sale?"]
He scoffs. "What do you take me for, a simpleton Luddie farmer from Chalcedon?"
His eyes dart at Bornanew to see if this one landed. $global.jethroName appears to be looking toward another display in one of the side-rooms.
Menes turns back to you, his brow furrowed at Bornanew's impassiveness. "Come now, captain, I was told you're a serious spacer. Ruthless in battle and savvy in trade. Was I so misinformed?"

[Line 2825] [Option Selected: "Let's discuss credits. Would 700k open the question of a sale?"]
Something shines in Menes' eyes. "I speak hypothetically, of course," he says, "but I wouldn't begin to think of a sale for anything less than a million credits."

[Line 2825] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerCredits800k:"Outrageous. I couldn't imagine it's worth more than 800,000."
bffi_mpBuyerCredits1m:"I'll consider a million. But only if it's real."]

[Line 2826] [Option Selected: "Outrageous. I couldn't imagine it's worth more than 800,000."]
Menes sighs dramatically, "I suppose - and this is because I'm feeling charitable - I would entertain the notion of a mere 900,000 credits." He looks at you sharply, "And that's only because you're a fellow demarch."

[Line 2826] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerCredits800kJeffReact:"You're practically a saint. Now the matter of veracity..."]

[Line 2827] [Option Selected: "Outrageous. I couldn't imagine it's worth more than 800,000."]
Menes sighs dramatically, "I suppose - and this is because I'm feeling generous - I would entertain the notion of a mere 900,000 credits." He looks at you sharply, "And that's only because you've a League commission. It's practically charity!"

[Line 2828] [Option Selected: "Outrageous. I couldn't imagine it's worth more than 800,000."]
Menes sighs dramatically. "What am I, a charity?"
"I suppose," he muses, "I suppose I'm in an oddly generous mood to even be discussing this."

[Line 2828] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerCredits800kJeffReact:"You're practically a saint. Now the matter of veracity..."]

[Line 2829] [Option Selected: "You're practically a saint. Now the matter of veracity...";['bffi_mpBuyerCredits800k']]
You think you hear a snort from Bornanew, but perhaps he just scuffed the floor.

[Line 2829] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerVeracity2:Continue]

[Line 2830] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerWhoSold:"Who sold you the glove?"]

[Line 2831] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerWhoSold2:"Ulmus Pond sold you the glove, didn't he."]

[Line 2832] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerNeedTested:"I'll need to have the glove tested."]

[Line 2834] [Option Selected: "Who sold you the glove?"]
"I'm afraid I could not reveal my source just now," Menes says haughtily. "They are very exclusive, and, and... sensitive."

[Line 2835] [Option Selected: "Ulmus Pond sold you the glove, didn't he."]
"No, n- it's not- you can't-" Menes sputters for a moment, then crosses his arms. "I cannot confirm or deny your statement." 
"And even if Ulmus did," he continues, "I trust you to act honorably and not reveal this information. There are fanatics out there, you understand, who would do terribly unkind things to him if they found out."
"Why do you think I only do private showings? There's no telling what idea some Luddie might get." He sniffs, taking in Bornanew once more, "You know what I mean. A proper Luddic who actually believes in anything with real passion."
Bornanew presses his hands together and gives a little nod. 

[Line 2836] [Option Selected: "I'll need to have the glove tested."]
"Tested," Menes says, the word apparently putting a bad taste in his mouth. "What would this entail, some technician coming in for a visit?"

[Line 2836] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerNeedTested2:"That wouldn't be quite sufficient..."]

[Line 2837] [Option Selected: "That wouldn't be quite sufficient..."]
"The captain will need to take the glove as a... temporary loan." Bornanew speaks, startling Menes. The Knight had moved silently to a position behind you and Menes. 
"Nanoforge facilities provide the means to determine the date and manufacture of the glove. It would ensure that it matches the correct era, age, and style. The Church has records, you see. Detailed records."

[Line 2837] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerNeedTested3:"Precisely. Well put, $global.jethroName."]

[Line 2838] [Option Selected: "Precisely. Well put, $global.jethroName."]
"Inconceivable," Menes says, scowling. "This is a unique relic of immense value. I can't let you simply walk away with it."
"Besides, this is completely unnecessary," he continues. "Gens Yaribay has a reputation for honest dealing going back generations!"

[Line 2839] Menes will need convincing. If you made a few good arguments, he will surely fold.

[Line 2840] Menes still needs convincing. A couple more good points should do it.

[Line 2841] Menes looks almost convinced. One more solid point should do it.

[Line 2853] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerCallRaid:Call in the prepared marines instead]

[Line 2854] [Option Selected: "In fact, the Church is backing my purchase." (lie)]
He doesn't see the shock on Bornanew's face. "Is that so?" Menes asks, sounding pleased.
Bornanew quickly shakes his head, no, and makes a little cut-off motion with his hand.

[Line 2854] [Options Given: bffi_mpBuyerConChurchA:"Absolutely. I wasn't supposed to tell, but it's why I'm here." (commit)
bffi_mpBuyerConChurchB:"No, no, just a little joke. My apologies." (back off)]

[Line 2855] [Option Selected: "Absolutely. I wasn't supposed to tell, but it's why I'm here." (commit)]
As you commit to the lie, Bornanew gives you a look of absolute weariness.
Menes turns to him, "This is true? This is why you're here, isn't it. The backing of the Church, of course!"
"Yes," Bornanew says robotically, his attempt at a pleasant countenance looks like an appalling mask of pain.
Even Menes seems to sense something is off. "Are you feeling well, Knight?" he asks. "Perhaps you aren't used to the quality of drink I serve."

[Line 2856] [Option Selected: "No, no, just a little joke. My apologies." (back off)]
Bornanew closes his eyes, and you hear his sigh of relief.
Menes glances at him, giving a funny look, then back at you. "Ah, of course. Ha-ha." He clears his throat. "Odd folk, you spacers," he says as if to himself.

[Line 2858] [Option Selected: "I'll provide a quarter deposit, right now, of 200,000 credits."]
Menes smirks, and holds out his TriPad, ready to accept your transfer code. Perhaps he feels like he's calling your bluff.

[Line 2859] [Option Selected: "I'll provide a quarter deposit, right now, of 225,000 credits."]
Menes smirks, and holds out his TriPad, ready to accept your transfer code. Perhaps he feels like he's calling your bluff.

[Line 2860] [Option Selected: "I'll provide a quarter deposit, right now, of 250,000 credits."]
Menes smirks, and holds out his TriPad, ready to accept your transfer code. Perhaps he feels like he's calling your bluff.

[Line 2861] You tap your TriPad to his and it gives a happy little ping.
"Ah," Menes looks down to confirm. "So you are serious. I must admit, your decisiveness is impressive. Most spacer captains, they're all talk. You," he lifts his eyebrows like a conspirator, "mean business."

[Line 2862] [Option Selected: "It may not be part of the League, but as a fellow executive of an independent colony..."]
"But of course," Menes says, pouring on a gracious act. "Silly me, so caught up in your reputation as a space captain... having a respectable title - you must understand - it is simply unexpected."
"We're the League!" He slaps a hand across your back. "We have to stick together, you know. Or the Hegemony will get us - or, precious Ludd, the Church might roll in to force us all to pray night and day, ha!" He looks toward Bornanew, "Ha-ha! A joke, friend, a joke."

[Line 2863] [Option Selected: "It may not be part of the League, but as a fellow executive of an independent colony..."]
"But of course," Menes says, pouring on a gracious act. "Silly me, so caught up in your reputation as just a space captain... having a respectable title - you must understand - it is simply unexpected."
"Well, I'm sure you'll join the League soon enough!" He slaps a hand across your back. "We have to stick together, you know. Or the Hegemony will get us - or, precious Ludd, the Church might roll in to force us all to pray night and day, ha!" He looks toward Bornanew, "Ha-ha! A joke, friend, a joke."

[Line 2864] [Option Selected: "My commissioned status with the Persean League must count for something."]
"No doubt!" Menes exclaims, "Why, I should have commended you earlier for your service to the League. I was so caught up in your reputation as a spacer - you know, adventures and schemes and the like - it completely slipped my mind that you're on our side." 
He slaps a hand across your back. "We appreciate your work, you know. Imagine if the Hegemony came for us - or, precious Ludd, imagine if the Church rolled in to force us all to pray night and day, ha!" He looks toward Bornanew, "Ha-ha! A joke, friend, a joke."

[Line 2865] [Option Selected: "I have a financial backer, Rayan Arroyo..." (lie)]
"Rayan Arroyo, you say?" Menes perks up. "Yes, I do believe I've met the man. An honest dealer. No-nonsense. Good head on his shoulders. Fantastic taste... have you met his tailor? Stars above, a wonder! I should have them cloned."
"Well," he nods to himself, "I admit this does change my perspective. You should have mentioned him before!"

[Line 2866] [Option Selected: "Your cousin Horus Yaribay trusted me with his diplomatic credentials..."]
You draw your TriPad and demonstrate.
"By the stars, he did," Menes says, eyes wide. "I knew I recognized your name from somewhere! There must have been a comms sent to the upper gens about this ploy Horus was running. That's cousin Horus for you, isn't it? Always pushing his little projects."
"Well," he looks as if he's reappraising you, "If you're good enough for cousin Horus, I suppose I could be convinced to make certain allowances."

[Line 2867] [Option Selected: "$global.jethroName, will you explain why this is necessary?"]
"Captain $playerName trusts you implicitly," Bornanew explains, "So as $playerHisOrHer advisor, I must act the skeptic. I assure you, Demarch Yaribay, it brings me no pleasure to appear to question and besmirch your fine reputation."
He speaks with such sincerity, for just a moment you can almost believe $global.jethroName isn't lying.
"Consider it a policy of 'trust, but verify'. We trust you, of course. But what of your source? We would never wish to see you cheated, but alas, I know too well that sin which lives in the human heart... If anything, I believe your only weakness is being too kind a spirit, too generous a benefactor."

Menes begins to nod, especially as Bornanew hits the last part of his 'explanation'.
"Yes," he exhales, "I suppose you're right. I am, if anything, too giving. This was so true on Kazeron, where the resentful and dishonest sought to tear me down and entrap me in one scandal after another."
"Out here, the social environment is more rarified, more, dare I say it? Honest. Even if it is a hopeless backwater, I do try to illuminate the locals with the light of Kazeronian culture..."

[Line 2869] "Well, I suppose that does it!" Menes claps his hands together.

[Line 2870] [Options Given: bffi_buyerSumOut2:"It does?"]

[Line 2871] [Option Selected: "It does?"]
"Certainly! I'll have my secretary make the arrangements. But first - a toast to the start of what I am sure will be a bountiful partnership! Back to the party!"
"Even you," he slaps a hand on Bornanew's shoulder, pulling him along, "Surely you know how to celebrate a deal, my dour unbeliever? Perhaps not, so I'll show you!"

You and Bornanew are hauled back into the party, and the small crowd regaled with insinuations about a 'large purchase' by an unnamed 'wealthy spacer captain'.
Menes grows less discreet, winking and nudging with each retelling - and with each additional round of drinks. His dutiful entourage joins in to toast a 'new business deal' and theorize about extensions to Menes' complex.
You can see the skinny man, Ulmus Pond, watching you. He has a particularly manic, piercing laugh.

"He's a Pather agent," Bornanew says as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. He meets your look.
"We spoke briefly," he explains. "The circumstantial evidence is convincing enough, but it was his heretical understanding of theology which I found truly damning."
"I propose we retire from this, ah, celebration as soon as we can with the glove. Then investigate Pond."

It is a feat of diplomacy that Bornanew manages to extract you as quickly as he does.
You have little difficulty playing up a state of stumbling drunkenness as Bornanew makes excuses, explaining that he will "pray for the captain's intemperance", much to the amusement of Menes' guests.
It is not your most dignified moment, but it ensures you can avoid the ritual of shaking everyone's hand, exchanging pleasant words, and going through the motions of good-byes.

BFFI Menes party Horus route
------------------------------
[Line 2879] [Options Given: 2:bffi_apHorus0:Shuttle down with Horus Yaribay to Menes' compound.]

[Line 2880] [Option Selected: Shuttle down with Horus Yaribay to Menes' compound.]
Horus transfers to your $shipOrFleet in orbit, greeting you and Bornanew tersely then making little in the way of conversation.
Menes' invitation provides you with a flight path and Demarch-level traffic control override codes. Horus would certainly receive similar treatment had he declared his presence openly.
As it is, it's probably a violation of Persean League ethical guidelines for you to be using these to attend a personal party, but from what you can overhear of the pilot's comms, the locals have a casual attitude toward the arrangement.

[Line 2880] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus1:Continue]

[Line 2881] [Option Selected: Continue]
Menes Yaribay's compound is a scrubbed-looking slab of trendy architecture set on a bluff overlooking Olinadu's primary habitation cluster.
A smattering of outbuildings and hangars, attached by fat trunks of conduit and glowing walktubes, sprawl across the less-fashionable view-angles of the compound toward the refineries and holding tanks of the planet's industrial center.

[Line 2881] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus2:Continue]

[Line 2882] [Option Selected: Continue]
One set of hangar bay doors dutifully open, and your shuttle descends through the glowing atmo-field. Such gadgetry is an ostentatious addition to a personal residence, but it avoids the bother of visitors (and their shuttles) having to undergo pressure-cycling.
An enthusiastic Menes is already approaching your shuttle's access ramp as it sets itself down and signals the all-clear.
Horus Yaribay puts out his hand in a 'you first' gesture.

[Line 2882] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus3:Meet Menes Yaribay]

[Line 2883] [Option Selected: Meet Menes Yaribay]
"Captain $playerName - with your Knight of Ludd! Let me welcome you both to my humble..."
As Menes sees Horus step off the shuttle his face contorts through a fascinating sequence of expressions before settling into an alarmed rictus of welcome.
"C-cousin Horus. What an unexpected surprise!"
Menes' eyes, watery with a minor aspect of terror, dart to yours then away before the accusation fully solidifies.

[Line 2883] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus4:Continue]

[Line 2884] [Option Selected: Continue]
Horus' smile in return is cool as he steps forward to the offered hands with only one of his own. "Menes. Where has the last cycle gone? It feels as though your inaugural flight to Olinadu was just yesterday."
Menes manages to respond with an obliging laugh.
Bornanew, quite forgotten, follows you and the Yaribays.

[Line 2884] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus5:Continue]

[Line 2885] [Option Selected: Continue]
Menes leads your party past gilded statues guarding the portal to the main complex; the forms are evocative of splashes of molten gold frozen by happenstance into sensual humanoid figures.
You watch as Horus, lean and intense as some small predator, endures the patter from Menes, a man of more generous form and character. Menes plays down the 'frontier quality' of renovations, the poor selection of artworks, the difficulty of accessing the best artists and engineering firms to contribute to his home in 'all but exile'.
Occasionally a robotic or human servitor appears to offer drinks or nibbles, and you've a growing feeling that Menes has picked up a glass from one only to place it back on the tray of another without ever taking a sip.
A fresh glass in hand, Menes tentatively leads Horus into what can only be his prize entertaining space.

[Line 2885] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus6:Follow]

[Line 2886] [Option Selected: Follow]
The space is at once cavernous and intimate; the sightlines and carved, wrought, or woven details calculated to replicate a feeling of cozy warmth like the den of some thoughtful patron of art, history, and literature.
A double handful of well-dressed remoras mill about, interrupting their conversations to turn as Menes enters. They look to be a collection of industrialists, financiers, distant gens-relatives, and at least one officer from atop the local military detachment who appears a little worse for his drink.

[Line 2886] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus7:Continue]

[Line 2887] [Option Selected: Continue]
Most start to give a politic nod and wave of acknowledgement at Menes' entrance, but stop and stare as they recognize Horus at his side. Few eyes linger on you and Bornanew, who steps apart as though he were a mere assistant or servitor.
One skinny man in a finely embroidered suit is not put off by Horus' entrance, and rushes to greet your party, eyes agog mostly at the gens patriarch, but sparing a glance at least for the newest additions to Menes' collection.

[Line 2887] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus8:Continue]

[Line 2888] [Option Selected: Continue]
He nearly trips over himself to speak. "The great Horus Yaribay! Your reputation precedes you, if half of what-"
Horus holds up a hand, silencing the man, and turns aside. "Menes, what is this?"
"Ha- ha, ah, this is Ulmus Pond," Menes replies quickly, his drinkless off-hand waving to shoo Pond away. "Ulmus, not now. Perhaps see that Captain $playerLastName's Luddic friend here has a fresh drink? Thank-you."
"Now, cousin Horus, I must offer a thousand apologies." Menes himself turns, also cutting Pond out of the conversation. "Had you signalled ahead we could have arranged for a proper reception..."

[Line 2888] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus9:Watch the fallout]

[Line 2889] [Option Selected: Watch the fallout]
"Never mind that," Horus says, looking around with a displeased curl to his lip. His gaze slips over Pond like he's nothing.
Ulmus Pond, for his part, hides the evil look that crossed his face in that moment to slink after Bornanew.

[Line 2889] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus10:Continue]

[Line 2890] Horus snaps his fingers, summoning a tray, and selects something effervescent. He takes a slow sip, not allowing his expression to display any sort of pleasure in the act. It seems to him more like a necessary palate-cleanser.
"Show it to me," he says to Menes. An order.

[Line 2890] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus10:Continue]

[Line 2891] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Captain $playerLastName shall attend," Horus adds quietly. "So that we might fully resolve this matter."
"Of course, cousin, of course!" Menes, sweating, puts on a fragile grin in order to distribute reassuring nods to his extended entourage.
Menes leads you and Horus into his inner sanctum, flashing a grimace as he operates a series of obtrusive and, to your eyes, largely ornamental biometric checks.

[Line 2891] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus11:Follow]

[Line 2892] [Option Selected: Follow]
The air cools by a degree, perhaps two, the armored mass of the walls felt as a dullness through your feet. The subdued lighting, drapery, and framing of the space suggest the interior of a bank vault or a shrine, though not to the praise of any Luddic virtue.
Quite the contrary, depending on one's outlook.

[Line 2892] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus12:Continue]

[Line 2893] [Option Selected: Continue]
On a pedestal of carved wood, in a spot of light like holy revelation, a single glove is upthrust. Its fingers appear frozen in the midst of beginning to curl back toward a relaxed state after giving you a little wave.
After an appropriate pause, Menes speaks up, hopeful. "What do you think, cousin?"

[Line 2893] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus13:Continue]

[Line 2894] [Option Selected: Continue]
"What's this supposed to be," says Horus, deadpan.
Menes clears his throat, then begins in a low, dramatic voice, "The glove worn by Ludd when stepping upon the sacred Earth of Gilead. Ludd removed the glove and kissed the ground, according to the Luddic's religion."

[Line 2894] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus14:"And it's almost certainly a fake."]

[Line 2895] [Option Selected: "And it's almost certainly a fake."]
Menes looks shocked.
Horus gives you a look of his own. "Of course it is," he says. "And here I thought only a Luddie would be foolish enough to believe in this sort of thing."
"Cousin!" Menes exclaims, appalled.
"Do not 'cousin' me!" Horus shouts, now, after an icy restraint held for so long.
"Remember how I saved you last time? The promises you made? And here, you've wasted stars-know how many credits on more nonsense, a bomb waiting to explode under the gens!"

[Line 2895] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus15:Keep your mouth shut, for now]

[Line 2896] [Option Selected: Keep your mouth shut, for now]
"What would Reynard Hannan do if he knew what you were up to here, do you think?"
Menes shakes his head, speechless.
"He would loose the Church on us! And their bloody-minded Pathers! Think, think for once, 'cousin'." Horus spits the word poisonously. "Think of anyone in the Sector aside from yourself. Think of your gens!"
"The Chu- Path?" Menes sputters pathetically. "If Captain $playerLastName said it's a fake, it shouldn't be-"
"Oh, so now it's a fake?" Horus cuts him off. "Enough! Here is what will happen."

[Line 2896] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus16:Continue]

[Line 2897] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Captain $playerLastName and $playerHisOrHer pet Knight of Ludd shall take possession of the damnable trinket. Immediately. As a sign of good faith to our Luddic 'friends' in the Church of Galactic Redemption."
He gives you a look, "See that they appreciate what I've done for them."
Back to Menes. "From now on I am taking personal control of your accounts. No frivolities without approval from my office."
Menes begins to make a sound of objection but is cut off as Horus raises a single finger. A Reaper torpedo, armed and ready to launch into the unshielded breach.
"You and I," Horus says, "Shall continue our conversation in private." He doesn't turn to you again. "Captain, if you would kindly?"

[Line 2897] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus17:Take the glove]

[Line 2898] [Option Selected: Take the glove]
Despite knowing what it is - or, rather, isn't - it feels almost like sacrilege to simply reach over to touch this object of such presumed expense and such evident disgrace. A vessel assigned such power and import, faith and violence, despite its reified deceit.
It is the glowing prize at the center of this temple, this shrine to the ego of Menes Yaribay bought with the lucre of the Kazeronian empire, fueled by faith and blood from over two hundred cycles since someone who took the name Ludd did something, probably, half-remembered then gilded in glorious myth on a planet named Gilead.

[Line 2899] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus19:Take the glove]

[Line 2900] [Option Selected: Take the glove]
As you touch it, a piercing alarm shatters the stillness of the treasury. Menes' hand slaps his other wrist with surprising speed. He raises it to his mouth to mumble a stand-down order to his security.
The alarm stops, leaving a painful echo in your ears.

The cousins of Gens Yaribay watch you leave.
Horus' eyes are black. Menes's are red with betrayal.

[Line 2901] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus21:Make your way back to the party to find Bornanew and leave]

[Line 2902] [Option Selected: Carry it openly back to the party]
The cousins of Gens Yaribay watch you leave.
Horus' eyes are cool, unblinking. Menes' are red with betrayal.

[Line 2902] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus21:Make your way back to the party to find Bornanew]

[Line 2903] [Option Selected: Make your way back to the party to find Bornanew]
Everyone turns and the conversation goes silent as you return to the main room. Alone.
You spot Bornanew, cornered by the man Ulmus Pond whose voice rings out for two words over-loudly as he realizes the fact of your entrance a moment later than the others.
His eyes are huge and bulging, like a fish.

[Line 2903] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus22:"Hello $global.jethroName. I think we should go now."]

[Line 2904] [Option Selected: Make your way back to the party to find Bornanew]
Everyone turns to stare at you as the conversation goes silent the instant you return to the main room. Alone.
You spot Bornanew, cornered by the man Ulmus Pond whose voice rings out for two words over-loudly because he realized the fact of your entrance a moment later than everyone else. His eyes are huge and bulging, like a fish.
They seem to widen even more as Pond sees that you are simply holding Menes' prize relic. Bornanew, even, struggles to maintain his composure as he realizes what you have in your hands.

[Line 2904] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus22:"Hello $global.jethroName. I think we should go now."]

[Line 2905] [Option Selected: "Hello $global.jethroName. I think we should go now."]
Pond gapes, enhancing the piscine effect.
Bornanew places an untouched drink of something fizzy and golden into Pond's hand, then walks with you back toward the shuttle bay.
"I presume you have... it?" he asks quietly, eyes forward.

[Line 2905] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus23b:"Yes."
bffi_apHorus23e:"Yup. Have a look for yourself." (give him the glove)

Pond gapes at you, furthering the piscine effect.
Bornanew places an untouched drink of something fizzy and golden into Pond's hand, then walks with you back to the shuttle bay.
"I think, perhaps," he says quietly, eyes forward, "that you should have put the glove somewhere out of sight."

[Line 2906] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus23a:"Here, you take it."
bffi_apHorus23b:"Perhaps you're right."
bffi_apHorus23c:"Maybe. But did you see their faces, $global.jethroName?"]

[Line 2907] [Option Selected: "Here, you take it."]
He accepts the glove, a little surprised, quickly placing it within some hidden pocket of his robes.

[Line 2907] [Options Given: bffi_partyOutro1:Continue]

He simply nods, placing his hands together. He doesn't do anything more, but you swear he's praying.

[Line 2910] [Option Selected: "Yup. Have a look for yourself." (give him the glove)]
He accepts the glove, taking only a split second to suppress his look of shock. Bornanew quickly disappears the glove to some hidden pocket of his robes.
"I think, perhaps," he says in a whisper, "that should have remained hidden."

[Line 2910] [Options Given: bffi_apHorus23b:"Perhaps you're right."

BFFI Menes party Raid
------------------------------
[Line 2914] [Option Selected: Enter the vault]
On a pedestal of carved wood, in a spot of light like holy revelation, a single glove is upthrust. Its fingers appear frozen in the midst of just starting to curl back toward a relaxed state after giving you a little wave.

[Line 2914] [Options Given: bffi_mpRaid0:Continue]

[Line 2915] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Do you know what this is?" Menes whispers to you. 
"It looks like a glove, demarch," Bornanew answers in feigned misunderstanding, stepping forward.

[Line 2915] [Options Given: bffi_mpRaid1:Continue]

[Line 2916] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Not any glove," Menes says with more than a hint of vexation.
He begins again in a reverent whisper, "The glove worn by Ludd upon stepping upon the sacred Earth of Gilead. Ludd removed the glove and kissed the ground, according to the Luddic religion. Isn't that right, sir Knight? And this... is it."
Bornanew looks at you, his eyebrows rising. "Could it be?" he asks, allowing some melodrama to enter his voice.

[Line 2916] [Options Given: bffi_mpRaid2:"I'm impressed, Menes. A relic from a pivotal moment of the Sector's history!"
bffi_mpCallRaid:Call in the raid]

[Line 2917] [Option Selected: "I'm impressed, Menes. A relic from a pivotal moment of the Sector's history!"]
"Precisely my reaction upon first hearing word of this unique artifact!" Menes beams, more than a little pleased that someone appreciates his trinket.
"Setting aside its purely religious significance," he gives a glance at Bornanew, "it represents a, a heralding of the changing tides of history! The ebbing influence of the Domain-era megacorporations, the rising of what some call - not my words of course, sir Knight - an atavistic populism. Truly, it is this small piece of the vastness of the story of Humanity which called to me when it was first described to me..."
Menes seems prepared to continue this for quite some time.

[Line 2917] [Options Given: bffi_mpCallRaid:Call in the raid]

[Line 2918] Menes is blathering on about something or other while Bornanew pretends to listen.

[Line 2919] Menes is blathering on about something or other while Bornanew pretends to listen.

[Line 2920] [Option Selected: Call in the prepared marines instead]
This isn't working. It's a good thing you prepared a backup plan.
You'll simply call in a marine raid while keeping Menes distracted. You give a grim nod to Bornanew and with only a small pause he follows your lead, asking Menes an insightful question about another item in his collection.

[Line 2921] [Option Selected: Call in the raid;['mktRaidGoBack', '$global.BFFIcommittedToRaid', 'score:1000'];['mktGoBack', '$global.BFFIcommittedToRaid', 'score:1000']]
You glance at your comms. Everything has been planned ahead of time, and care taken to hide tactical teams among the general population of offworld crew taking a bit of shore-leave. Signal discipline has been unerring.
The coded response, hidden in routine status reports, shows all teams are prepped and ready to move.

[Line 2921] [Options Given: mktRaidNonMarket:Continue]

[Line 2922] Menes is describing another of his expensive acquisitions when the lights cut out.
A moment passes in absolute darkness, the crushing weight of silence falling as the ventilation whirs to a stop. This is the terrible abyss of spacers' death; a reminder that you exist by the whim of machines caught in deadly vacuum, in a precarious balance of temperature and artificial atmosphere.
The subdued red emergency lighting strips flicker to life. Menes produces a nervous smile, "I'm sure it's just, um, a glitch." He mumbles something into his cuff, then gives it a confused shake.
Comms down. By the plan.

[Line 2923] "It's probably- I'm certain- I, I," Menes stutters, "The power will come back soon. Those rad-addled Olinadu contractors," he attempts a nervous laugh.
You feel the dull thuds, nearly subsonic, through the armored mass of the vault. Breaching charges for the first layer of defense. You know the big one will come soon, and where.
Menes is in a growing panic.

[Line 2923] [Options Given: bffi_mpRaidOutro2:"Perhaps, Menes, we should take cover..."]

[Line 2924] [Option Selected: "Perhaps, Menes, we should take cover..."]
When the marines finally breach the vault proper, it is with overwhelming force of sound and light. No unprotected human can withstand this assault on the senses; you are blinded, shocked, and rendered immobile. All you can do is cling to the kernel of self at the center of a storm of pain.
* * *
The return is slow, an awakening from a terrible and drugged sleep to emergency medical personnel and Menes' somewhat tardy security teams in their gleaming armor.
You and Bornanew leave the compound among the other victims. Bandaged, bruised, head aching, ears ringing.

[Line 2925] [Option Selected: Continue]
Hours later, after a series of transfers to obscure your movements from the heightened official surveillance, you step back onto your own shuttle - and the attentions of your personal medical team.
A chime on your TriPad confirms that the operation was a success. A holo of the simple work-glove that human beings fought and died over rotates mockingly. 
"Evidence," Bornanew says, tired but alert. His eyes are alarmingly bloodshot. "The seed of schism and war. Now whence did this come?"

[Line 2925] [Options Given: bffi_mpRaidOutro4a:"I don't suppose we could ask Menes."
bffi_mpRaidOutro4b:"What did you make of that Ulmus Pond?"]

[Line 2927] [Option Selected: "What did you make of that Ulmus Pond?"]
"A Pather agent," he says conclusively.
"We spoke briefly," he says. "In the aftermath. He insisted the medical team check him. Wasn't hurt." 
Bornanew takes a deep breath, wincing. "But he slipped up. Heretical theology. Devil in the details. You can tell where one learned the Word, or, rather, a corruption of the Word, from the details."
"He may be connected, but first we should ask the glove." He looks back down at the holo.

"A nanoforge engineer could tell us much of this object," he says. "Who made it. When, and where. By the truths found in the false glove, we may judge answers we receive from those we... ask." His last word is muted by the shuttle's maneuverings.
"The Church's nanoforge is on Asher. Canaan system. The techs there will submit to the authority I bear. Our inquiry will be secret."
He pauses, and looks away. "So far as anything is, in the Church."

Your comms officer intercepts you on the way to the medbay looking determined but apologetic.

[Line 2932] [Option Selected: "Then we'd better go fast when we go."]
"$PlayerSirOrMadam." They salute and step back so the med tech can finish waving a scanner - the high-pitched hum just inside your hearing - in search of broken bones. $global.jethroName undergoes a similar procedure in the next bay.
Before the hour you are discharged with a smart stimpack strapped to your side, under your uniform jacket, to control the pain and keep you alert.
You're not out yet. You can easily see that the local authorities don't discover Menes' trinket if your $shipOrFleet is searched, but that search would waste valuable time and disrupt operations.

[Line 2939] [Option Selected: "I'm still consulting with experts. Top experts."]
"Indeed? I suppose an object of such quality and... value," he emphasizes the word, "requires very careful examination." 
He pauses, glancing down for a moment.
"I... I should hate to delay you. Though I am in no rush for the full payment of course, ha-ha." He laugh is unconvincing.

[Line 2940] It takes longer than before to open the link.
Menes' image flickers into pseudoreality and is still but for the occasional wave of algorithmic correction.
"Captain, oh captain," he says finally, his voice more brittle than before. There are dark circles under his eyes. "Things have not been well."

[Line 2946] [Option Selected: "I was nearly killed at your 'party', Menes. We were both there."]
A joyless smirk flits over his face. 
"But you were not. The raiders were careful, very careful. Careful." He stares at you for a long moment, breathing heavily. Into his drink, perhaps? 

[Line 2947] [Option Selected: "I'm truly sorry to hear that. I wanted to check in..."]
A troubled look crosses his face. 
"Your concern is..." he looks away, and the moment draws longer. He's breathing heavily. Into his drink, perhaps? 

[Line 2948] [Option Selected: "Is this about losing the... relic?"]
"So you heard," his eyebrows raise. A spark of suspicion. 
"The glove is not the point, my dear captain." He frowns. "My sanctuary was violated. My things stolen. My... friends assaulted." He stares at you for a long moment, breathing heavily. Into his drink, perhaps?

"No!" he says too-loudly, and upon realizing it, corrects himself, "No. Now is good. We must speak, you and I."

His eyes go wide, and his arm grabs at the side of his desk, pulling him to a more formal sitting position.

Bornanew places the glove carefully into a clear-sided containment vessel, the kind used by salvors to take biological samples. Illuminated by the vessel's interior glowstrips, the glove seems to be held in a reliquary shining with holy light.

BFFI talk to Engineer

[Line 2988] [Options Given: 3:bffi_talkToEngineer0:Use Bornanew's authority to meet with a nanoforge engineer ]

[Line 2989] [Option Selected: Use Bornanew's authority to meet with a nanoforge engineer]
Bornanew assists your comms officer in navigating through various levels of Church bureaucracy.
Before long, you have the senior nanoforge engineer of Asher on a comms-link.

[Line 2989] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer1:Continue]

[Line 2990] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Yes, hello? Uh, good day? I was told there was an investigation." 
She seems to examine you through the link. "You don't look much like a Knight of Ludd."

[Line 2990] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer2:"I need an object analyzed. Very closely."]

[Line 2991] [Option Selected: "I need an object analyzed. Very closely."]
"I see." $PersonName takes a moment more to examine you, humming to herself.
"Forensic material analysis. Skilled work." $HeOrShe frowns. "It won't be cheap."
She looks at some other display and starts tapping at an input. "You'll have to bring the sample down, of course."

[Line 2991] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngShuttle:Shuttle to the engineer's laboratory]

[Line 2992] [Option Selected: Shuttle to the engineer's laboratory]
Bornanew's authority - that of the Archcurate Sophronia Jaspis, in truth - is as good with the local traffic authority as it is with the Manufactoria Guild bureaucrats.
Your shuttle descends into the atmosphere of Asher. The view shades toward a warm, murky gray as you descend through the stratospheric fines perpetually refreshed by towering dust storms. The display blots out entirely and switches to a false-rendering as you enter the lower atmosphere.
There is no hazard; the storms are impressive in scale but low in mass due to the deathly thin atmosphere.

[Line 2992] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer4:Continue]

[Line 2993] [Option Selected: Continue]
Senior Engineer Tanaica places the glove and its containment vessel onto a shelf which retracts into the towering white casing of the analysis suite. Transparent panes, probably diamond-matrix, reveal arcane inner workings.
She hits a command to evacuate the atmo from the sample slot, and sets a manipulator to extract the glove and place it on the scanning bed. All of this she performs with a casual ease born of practice. She speaks as she taps away at the control interface.
"If it came from a high-quality nanoforge like what the Heggies or League's got, this might not tell us much." 
Some kind of protective barrier shunts down, hiding the glove from view. A holo of the glove emerges from a display unit, gaining resolution until a doppelganger rotates in the air before you.

[Line 2993] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer5:Continue]

[Line 2994] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Hm. Good output, this. But I'm thinking not good-perfect. Ludd...ics," her eyes dart at Bornanew, "No offense, but they don't go in for training much native talent. S'why you lot pay me."
"Anyway, when you get into really delicate products, your forge quality starts to matter. A work-rated vac-glove though?" She rolls her eyes. "This better be good."
The analysis suite is making some kind of humming sound, and there's a clunk. The engineer doesn't react, so neither do you. Her display erupts with numbers and icons, then something she does pulls a cutaway from the holo-glove, which scales as the rest of it disappears. 
Another segmentation of scale iterates, then another.

[Line 2994] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer6:Watch closely]

[Line 2995] [Option Selected: Watch closely]
"We can see signs of what we call 'drift' here," she says. A colored indicator ring flashes around an orderly pattern of small-scale structures deep within the glove, the representation of individual atoms, perhaps, just visible like the grain of sandstone.
"These defects are unique to the faults in an individual nanoforge. More or less." 
"Like a fingerprint," Bornanew says.
"No." The engineer shrugs. "But sure, if you like."

[Line 2995] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer7:"What's this tell us?"]

[Line 2996] [Option Selected: "What's this tell us?"]
"Someone's been naughty," she says, sounding more delighted than upset. "The glove is new, but the model is old. A closed-source pre-Collapse template. There are fabrication-rights codes embedded in its structure."
With a tap, another colored indicator ring flashes on a sheared-square section of material containing a complex pattern. "Tells the forge not to make unauthorized copies."
"Closed products from the Domain-era tend to be far higher quality than forges running post-Collapse hacks." She smiles, "This isn't that, but it's close. Tells us two things."

[Line 2996] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer8:"Which are?"]

[Line 2997] [Option Selected: "Which are?"]
"One, this was made by an industrial-grade Domain-era forge. Heavy industry stuff. Bit of a waste to use it to make a glove," she glances at you, "If you ask me."
"Two, either this forge is loaded with valid fabrication rights and it's damaged, or it's been hacked to bypass the embedded copy protections. And it's damaged. I mean, stars and ruin, look at this mess," she zooms in on the 'drift' patterns while making a disgusted look.
$global.jethroName speaks up now, "Three, we're dealing with a sophisticated forgery operation."
The engineer shoots a look back at him, "Neat."

[Line 2997] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer9:"What forge made this? Where's it from?"]

[Line 2998] [Option Selected: "What forge made this? Where's it from?"]
"Right," she manipulates the interface again.
The drift-pattern from the glove remains locked, and she brings up similar - but distinct - examples of patterns in an expanding grid. Small labels show a string of glyphs, most of which contain the names of industrial combines, shipyards, and polities known to you. Some you recognize as dating to the Collapse. Others are unfamiliar.
"This is the drift library we've got here on Asher. Useful stuff, but other factions got better."

[Line 2998] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer10:"So you can match the 'drift' to the forge."]

[Line 2999] [Option Selected: "So you can match the 'drift' to the forge."]
"Exactly," she's pleased that you put it together. "Got bad news though, cap. Your glove doesn't match anything in this library."

[Line 2999] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer11a:"Can drift be obscured, faked?"
bffi_talkToEngineer11b:"So it's not a known forge."]

[Line 3000] [Option Selected: "Can drift be obscured, faked?"]
"Could be," she admits. "Takes a clever setup and a talented operator though. If this is fake drift, then it goes real high up. Don't know who'd be capable of it that'd waste that kind of effort on a glove."

[Line 3001] [Option Selected: "So it's not a known forge."]
"Maybe, maybe not," she says.
"The Church doesn't put much into material analysis. What you'd do, ideally, is collect statistically significant samples, run scans on every new product that shows up, put anything interesting through a detailed scan like this, build a library. It's not cheap," she says wistfully.
"But here they're mostly interested in making sure their hyperdrives work to min-spec. The Church of No-fun." She looks at Bornanew, "Sorry."
He nods, untroubled.

[Line 3002] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer11a:"Can drift be obscured, faked?"]

[Line 3003] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer11b:"So it's not a known forge."]

[Line 3004] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer12:"Anything else?"]

[Line 3005] [Option Selected: "Anything else?"]
"That's all I got, captain," she says, reversing the specimen insertion procedure and returning your containment vessel. "Good mystery. Hope it doesn't get you shot."
She hands the vessel to Bornanew, then claps her hands together. "That'll be 10,000 credits."

[Line 3006] [Options Given: BFFI_talkToEngineer12optDev1sel:DEV set player.ethosCynical to 2]

[Line 3016] [Option Selected: "Uh..."]
She looks between you and Bornanew.
"Didn't you tell your captain about the fee?" She asks.
You'd swear, Bornanew is almost blushing.

[Line 3017] [Option Selected: "Of course." (pay)]
You transfer the credits to Senior Engineer Tanaica's accounts while $global.jethroName holds the vessel.
Presumably she'll forward payment for lab expenses to the Church-approved Manufactoria Guild.

[Line 3018] [Options Given: bffi_postEngJethroTalk1:Continue]

[Line 3019] [Option Selected: "You serve the Church. Is this not corruption, $jethroName?"]
His neutral expression flickers.
"I... yes, the captain is correct. You are paid to serve the Church, and this," he hefts the ersatz reliquary, "is business of the Church."
"Right you are," says Senior Engineer Tanaica through a tight smile. "Good day, captain."
Her eyes flick at Bornanew. "Novice."

[Line 3019] [Options Given: bffi_talkToEngineer13corruption2:Continue]

[Line 3020] [Option Selected: Continue]
Bornanew's tone was righteous, but without heart. You suspect he was not going to make an issue of the 'payment' until you brought it up.
As you return to your shuttle he gives you a look- guilt?
"Such things are not uncommon even in the shadow the Church," he says. "And elsewhere. I'm sure you well know."
Bornanew returns his attention to his datapad. He's making his 'thinking face'."

[Line 3020] [Options Given: bffi_postEngJethroTalk2:"Out with it, $global.jethroName."]

[Line 3021] [Option Selected: "$global.jethroName?"]
He recovers quickly. "I, of course," he awkwardly hands the ersatz reliquary to you then draws an off-brand datapad from his robes. Engineer $personLastName blinks at it.
"I can pay from the, uh, accounts of The Reverend Archcurate Sophronia Jaspis... here."

[Line 3021] [Options Given: bffi_postEngJethroTalk1:Continue]

"Ulmus Pond," he says. Then looks up at you.
"That strange little man from Menes Yaribay's party. Obviously an agent for the Luddic Path. That the Path would have eyes and influence on Menes is no surprise. But if he's the one that supplied the glove..."
"We need to get to him," he says. "Confront him. Compel him to talk."

[Line 3033] [Option Selected: "Your oath. Of course."]
"Yes." Bornanew clears his throat.
"The word is that he has fled to Chalcedon on a tramp freighter, a smuggler, known to move materiel for the Luddic Path."

bffi_ulmusPondNotHere4b:"Then we follow."]

[Line 3034] [Option Selected: "Does an innocent man run?"]
He turns his head. "He might, if he had to. But I suspect that Ulmus is not an innocent man."

[Line 3035] [Option Selected: "Then we follow.";['bffi_ulmusPondNotHere4a']]

"He would be - have been - well placed as a bridge for some element of the Luddic Path to influence Menes Yaribay. He would be the source of the relic."

[Line 3042] [Option Selected: "Before we act, let us speak of your Knights' 'sources'."]
"I cannot," he says. "But I assure you they are as reliable as any heretic, guilty soul, or criminal." His look softens, "Do trust that I am not simply asking around a spacer bar for a lead."
A moment, then he gives a nod, almost a bow. "Um. I do not condemn your methods. Your directness has oft proven effectual."

[Line 3043] [Option Selected: "What if these are pirates, or a major faction misleading us?"]
"It could be either." Bornanew folds his hands together. "But we must look first where the light of truth shines brightest, dim though it may be, or known only by distinction against the shadow of deceit."

[Line 3044] [Option Selected: "Could your queries have revealed our intentions?]
"It is always possible." Bornanew meets your eyes, steady. "The Knights pursue heretics and criminals as routine, and my inquiries were worded to imply my interest lay not upon Ulmus Pond himself, nor the Menes situation. Though, of course, you and I are already known to be associated with both."
"Expediency anticipates risk. I beg you trust my judgment in this matter."

[Line 3045] [Option Selected: "Nav, set a course."]
Nav responds instantly to your orders.

Chalcedon rotates in the primary display before you.
Bornanew is at your side, tapping at his off-brand datapad, looking for all the worlds like a toy in his large hands.
"My sources indicate that a man matching the description of Ulmus Pond is almost certainly in a safehouse... here."
A highlighted point appears on the globe, some logistical center in the scablands trailing like a stain from the primary spaceport.

[Line 3049] [Options Given: bffi_ulmusPrestart2:Continue]

[Line 3050] [Option Selected: Continue]
Bornanew watches the point as the globe obligingly comes to a gentle stop. The highlighted section detaches from the globe, which collapses away, and spreads into a tactical overview.
"He acts like a man drowning, grasping for help without concern for his rescuers." He turns from the globe toward you, "In OPSEC terms, of course. He could have easily disappeared."
A bitter smile appears, "As once I did."

[Line 3051] [Option Selected: "Tactical, prep a shuttle. Let's have a chat with Ulmus Pond."]
Bornanew has his notebook and cheap old datapad packed in a satchel made of what looks like leather. You've heard of the primitive process the Luddics are said to use to produce the material; the skin of an animal is stripped then stewed, somehow, with its own waste products. It sounded unbearably primitive when described. Anti-Luddic misinformation, perhaps, because you don't detect the smell of feces at all.
"How shall we approach this?" Bornanew asks. "Like in MuniSec dramas- one of us is friendly to the subject, the other hostile?"

bffi_ulmusPondYouBad:"You be the bad guy."]

[Line 3052] [Option Selected: "I'll be the bad guy."]
Bornanew nods. Perhaps you're imagining it, but is that relief in the set of his eyes?

[Line 3053] [Option Selected: "You be the bad guy."]
Bornanew nods. Perhaps you're imagining it, but you feel like a coldness comes into the set of his eyes.

[Line 3054] Your personal security team has been briefed, and are dressed as a mix of common spacers, local techs, and Luddic laborers. Their arsenal is multitude and well-concealed.

[Line 3055] [Option Selected: ['bffi_ulmusPondLoadout2', '#$player.sdtu_weaponPistol']]
Your own hand finds your trusty sidearm, a matte polycarbonate pistol. An ideal firearm for use in tight spaces, its mass rests securely in your holster.

[Line 3056] [Option Selected: ['bffi_ulmusPondLoadout2', '$player.sdtu_weaponGrenade']]
You, of course, have your clutch of devilish little grenades built to resist milliradar detection. Fearful and unexpected, they trigger with a practiced twitch from your hand.

[Line 3057] [Option Selected: ['bffi_ulmusPondLoadout2', '$player.sdtu_weaponKnife']]
And you have hidden a vicious ceramic vibroknife on your person. It is not a tool to be underestimated, for when deployed by surprise it can even disable light power-armored opponents.

[Line 3058] [Option Selected: ['bffi_ulmusPondLoadout2', '$player.sdtu_weaponSpray']]
You are protected by a subtler weapon, a tiny capsule of spray-poison within your cuff. Hold your breath as it is deployed with a casual wave, and the target next to you will simply die as if of a massive, unexpected heart-attack.

[Line 3059] [Option Selected: ['bffi_ulmusPondLoadout2', '$player.sdtu_weaponWire']]
You, of course, have a monomolecular wire hidden in a false fingertip, ready to deploy into an invisible cutting edge with but a short, sharp twist. It is a venerable weapon favored by assassins of a certain class.

[Line 3060] [Option Selected: ['bffi_ulmusPondLoadout2', '$player.sdtu_weaponNone']]
You, of course, need trust nothing more than your limbs. Starship combat is mass and energy applied at scale; absurdly reduced to the scale of the human body, the mechanics applied are not completely dissimilar.

[Line 3061] [Option Selected: ['bffi_ulmusPondLoadout2', '$player.sdtu_weaponSword']]
Your hand finds the hilt of your officers' sword at your side, the mass of a steel blade a comfort shared with warriors dating to the primitive wars of Old Earth.

[Line 3063] [Option Selected: Continue]
You stand with Bornanew in an uncomfortably narrow alley. The sky above sends nasty rivulets of fluid down the conduits and moldy canopies that diffuse the light into a flattening murk.
Your security team is invisible, discreet in nearby alcoves and rooftops.
$global.jethroName runs his hands over a door, as if feeling under it's moisture-warped surface for a clue.

[Line 3064] "Ready, captain?" he asks. "Remember, you're the good guy."

"I am," he says.

[Line 3067] [Option Selected: "Don't you forget it.";['bffi_ulmusStart3a']]
Bornanew takes a step back then slams a powerful leg into a worn spot, about waist-high. With a sharp crack, the entire door falls inward, crumbling hinges and locking mechanism still attached.

[Line 3067] [Options Given: bffi_ulmusStart4:Follow]

[Line 3068] [Option Selected: Follow]
Bornanew charges inside. You follow his steps through an entryway, plastic rain cloaks mildewing, through a prefab kitchen and wash unit stained the yellow of old teeth. A sitting area, chair toppled. There's a muffled thump from above.
Bornanew glances at you, his eyes giving a bounce upwards. Ulmus Pond.

[Line 3068] [Options Given: bffi_ulmusStart5:Find a way upstairs]

[Line 3069] [Option Selected: Find a way upstairs]
A moment of frantic search reveals the narrow stairwell behind a loose wall-panel.
Bornanew pounds up the stairs, and you follow.
In his half-second lead, Bornanew has caught Ulmus Pond in a bearhug, Pond's skinny arms still grabbing at the loosened attachment-points of a sheet of translucent plastic which lies between him and the lightwell; escape. Pond loses his grip with a cry of despair as Bornanew pulls him away.
The window panel snaps back into place.

"Ulmus Pond," Bornanew roars with overbearing gusto, "This is no season to be opening a window!"
"Sit, I insist, before you hurt yourself! We are doubly blessed to find you so well. You must understand our fear- no answer to comms, rumors of kidnappings... Menes has been worried sick about his very good friend."
The bear-hug has turned into something like a side-grab as Bornanew sets Pond bodily onto the cot beside him. You're not sure if the creaking is from the cheap furniture or Pond' ribs.

[Line 3071] [Options Given: bffi_ulmusTalkBad1a:"More than worried. He suspects you, Pond. We're going to get answers."
bffi_ulmusTalkBad1b:"Easy $global.jethroName. Ulmus only had good intentions I'm sure."]

[Line 3072] [Option Selected: "More than worried. He suspects you, Pond. We're going to get answers."]
"A- answers?" Pond's eyes go wider still as he gasps for breath. "I, um, appreciate your concern but I'm fine, here. Nothing is the matter, truly!"
"Look at him, captain," Bornanew says. "He's an innocent. He'd tell us straightaway if some ill-intentioned party were taking advantage of his good nature."

[Line 3072] [Options Given: bffi_ulmusTalkBad2a:"No, I think Ulmus is behind it. We should do an active scan on his brain."
bffi_ulmusTalkBad2b:"Perhaps you're right, he does look pretty innocent."]

[Line 3073] [Option Selected: "No, I think Ulmus is behind it. We should do an active scan on his brain."]
"Ulmus?" Bornanew looks at you, shocked at the idea. 
"...'active' scan?" Ulmus manages to squeak.
"The captain would never," insists Bornanew. "You're a merchant, a middleman. You just wanted to help your friend Menes find a unique object for his collection. Isn't that right?" He gives Ulmus another squeeze.
"Y-yes, that's right," Ulmus says, looking between you and Bornanew. "I, uh, I set up connections. Deals. I help people!"

[Line 3073] [Options Given: bffi_ulmusTalkBad3a:"So you admit you 'helped' Menes buy a fake relic from the Pathers!"]

[Line 3074] [Option Selected: "Easy $global.jethroName. Ulmus only had good intentions I'm sure."]
Bornanew tips his head, giving you a confused look. 
"The good captain here thought someone," he pauses to give you a consternated expression, "-might be taking advantage of Menes. $PlayerHeOrShe wants to eliminate all suspects."
"I, for one, insisted to Menes that you must be the victim of some terrible scheme, and that I would pray for you, and, better yet, as a Knight of Ludd carry out my sworn duty to protect the faithful and innocent alike."
Bornanew gives Pond a squeeze to emphasize how safe he is, now.

[Line 3074] [Options Given: bffi_ulmusTalkBad2a:"Ulmus is behind it. We should perform an active scan on his brain."
bffi_ulmusTalkBad2b:"On second thought, I don't think Ulmus had anything to do with it."]

[Line 3075] [Option Selected: "On second thought, I don't think Ulmus had anything to do with it."]
Bornanew tips his head, giving you a confused look.
"The captain here told me," he pauses to give you a consternated expression, "-he thought you were working for Pathers, to sell Menes a fake relic to cause discord and make off with his credits. The captain told me $playerHeOrShe wanted to test an invasive brain-interfacer $playerHeOrShe found in some ruin on the fringe to discover the truth inside your head."
Pond's eyes go wide at the mention of 'brain-interface'.
"I, for one," Bornanew says reassuringly, "insisted that the plan was crude and unnecessary. Surely you're the victim of a terrible scheme..."

[Line 3075] [Options Given: bffi_ulmusTalkBad3a:"Ah... yes, that's right. We really should try the brain-interfacer."
bffi_ulmusTalkBad3b:"'Brain-interfacer'? What is this nonsense $global.jethroName?"]

[Line 3077] [Option Selected: "Ah... yes, that's right. We really should try the brain-interfacer."]
"I didn't know they were Pathers!" Pond shouts.
Bornanew pretends shock at the notion, looking at Ulmus and shaking his head.
"Or that it was a fake! I swear, I'm a legitimate entrepreneur! I've been set up. I have enemies, Menes has enemies, they- they must have set me up!"

[Line 3077] [Options Given: bffi_ulmusTalkBad4a:"Yet you ran. Right back to your Pather masters on Chalcedon."]

[Line 3078] [Option Selected: "'Brain-interfacer'? What is this nonsense $global.jethroName?"]
Bornanew tips his head, giving you a confused look.
"Now's not the time to play coy, captain. Your illegal brain-interfacer," he stresses the words, "which you proposed could 'scientifically prove' Pond's connection to a Pather network with only 'minimal damage'."
Pond looks rapidly between you and Bornanew, both scared and confused. "Minimal da-" he begins, then shifts course to avoid the subject entirely. "I didn't know they were Pathers!" he pleads.
"Or that it was a fake! I swear, I'm a legitimate entrepreneur. There's no need for brain-scans or, or- I've been set up! I have enemies, Menes has enemies, they- they must have set me up!"

[Line 3078] [Options Given: bffi_ulmusTalkBad4a:"But you ran, Ulmus. Right back to your Pather masters here on Chalcedon."]

[Line 3080] [Option Selected: "But you ran, Ulmus. Right back to your Pather masters here on Chalcedon."]
"I-I had no... you don't understand," Ulmus squirms.
Bornanew jumps in to direct Ulmus' narrative. "He must have been threatened," he says. "Blackmail! Of course. You help us find out who's really behind this! We'll make sure you're safe."

[Line 3080] [Options Given: bffi_ulmusTalkBad5a:"If, and only if, $global.jethroName, he helps us. Otherwise he goes to the Inquisitors."]

[Line 3081] [Option Selected: "If, and only if, $global.jethroName, he helps us. Otherwise he goes to the Inquisitors."]
"Surely there is no need to bring them in it," Bornanew puts on a look of saintly compassion.
"I know in my heart that Ulmus wants to confess and be absolved of his sins, of his crimes. He wants to leave this terrible time behind him and live a good life."
Pond's eyes go teary. "Y-yes, yes. I'll confess! I'll do penance, I'll pray! I'll tell you whatever you need. By Ludd, I beg forgiveness!"

Pond sniffles.
"There was... a Walker of the Path. He asked me to talk to Menes, to, to, to make the offer. He said Menes couldn't resist an artifact of such quality. And- and I was to arrange transport. Then make it appear legitimate. Set the documents straight, make it look correct."
Bornanew draws his cheap datapad from his satchel, the screen already set to a map of the greater Persean Sector.

"Are you man, or a bit of vermin slipping out the window?" Bornanew bellows as he lifts Pond bodily, setting him on a sagging cot. You're not sure if the creak is the cheap furniture or Pond's ribs. 
"The Knights have sent me a long way," his voice lowers threateningly, "to deal with you. Pray your answers are to my liking lest I deliver you unto the Knight Inquisitors. They have methods of seeking truth hidden far from God's merciful light."

"Yes, yes," he speaks quickly. "The captain has it right! Menes, he wanted something special. I'm just a middleman, a, a communicator. I just make deals!"
He licks his lips, looking between you and Bornanew, "Menes was so pleased, I had no idea it wasn't real. I'm no relic-dealer or, or a curate or- you have to believe me, I'm innocent!"

Bornanew tips his head at Pond and gives you a confused and consternated look. 
"No, no," Pond pleads at you, "No, no need for that, I'll- you see, it wasn't me, this is all a misunderstanding. I make deals. I'm a great communicator. Menes will tell you. It was business, just business!"

Bornanew gives a consternated shake of his head. Pond, terrified, looks between you and Bornanew. 
"The Captain," Bornanew says, "wanted to put you into protective custody. Said you wouldn't hurt anyone, you were threatened." Bornanew meets your eyes again and says, deliberately, "I don't believe you."
"But that's it!" Pond cries, "They said they'd- Pathers will do anything!"
"Pathers," Bornanew says, his voice icy. "You do know, Ulmus Pond, how we Knights deal with those heretics." Bornanew reaches into his satchel.
Pond goes paler, somehow. "N-no, no. I'll confess! I'll do penance, I'll pray! Tell him!" He looks to you.

Bornanew sighs deeply, dropping his previous countenance, and looks at you with almost a sadness in his eyes. "This is not as we agreed. I ask now that you stand aside and allow me to complete this unsavory task."
With that, his face goes blank and he turns, seizing Pond by the neck with one hand and lifting him off the cot with a choked sound.

In one smooth motion you draw your sidearm and place a shot in Sedge's head.
With a sigh, his body slides back against the wall, his eyes blank, his expression caught in a look of dumb surprise.

In one smooth motion you draw a grenade, sliding a finger along just-so to set yield to minimum, and gently toss it toward Sedge's head. You see the beginning of a confused start on his face before the flash, and a loud clap uncomfortable almost to the point of pain.
Sedge slides back against the wall, his face caught in the eternal surprise of death. Blood begins to trickle from his nose, his eyes, his ears, his mouth. The skin of his face blooms red. It will look like a bloated purple mass in only minutes.

In one smooth motion you raise your hand and activate the poison spray, angling upward and away from the bleeding body of Bornanew. A misting of the air disappears in a blink as if it were never there.
With a wet cough and a whining, choking sound, Sedge's body slides back against the wall. His eyes blink once at you, expression caught in a look of dumb surprise.

In a motion born of long hours of training, your leg snaps toward Sedge at the speed of thought. It meets the center of his head with full force, cracking his head back in a violent jerk.
A single shudder passes through his body, from his thick neck, already purpling from devastated bone and tissue, to his booted feet. His head slumps to the side at an unnatural angle, blood running from what remains of his nose, and his mouth and eyes.

Bornanew lives, by a thread.
In the moments since the exchange, a time hollowed out by violence and filled with the fleeting intensity of adrenaline, your security team appears.
Finding you unhurt, they attach stabilization packs and trauma strips to the fallen Knight. He's left an incredible pool of blood in the cheap apartment. It drips down the narrow stairs.
The other two bodies lie dead.
It is unclear how fully Ulmus Pond was exploited by or truly believed in the Pather cause, but his loyalty - if he ever had any - died with him.

You carry Bornanew's leather satchel to the shuttle. Your team carries his unconscious body. 
As it lifts, he is laid across several seats. The designated medic keeps close watch over the small ad-hoc network of medical machines.
Bornanew's datapad opens to your touch, allowing you to access the coordinates given by Ulmus Pond. And a recording of the brief interrogation. $global.jethroName planned for the possibility of his incapacitation, or death. And gave you access to his work.

A medical team rushes past you, to Bornanew, as you step out onto your flagship. 
He'll live, you are assured. But it'll hurt; this is left unsaid by your flagship's chief medical officer.
It is quite clear to you now that this is a Pather conspiracy, and they will kill to keep it from unravelling. Your next step is to the source of the fake relic: a lonely orbit on the fringe of the Persean Sector.
In the $bffi_patherStationSystem.

Bornanew's datapad trembles in Pond's hands. He cannot designate a star system until Bornanew holds the pad steady for him. A target.
"This Pather, Ulmus," Bornanew says, glancing at the datapad then placing it in his satchel. The threat retreats from his voice. "Tell us his name."
Tears stream down Ponds' face; the man looks deflated, and absolutely defeated. "Sedge," he says.
Bornanew shoots a look at you.

Pond nods, tears streaming down his face. He seems not to know what to do, and simply sits there slumped like a ragdoll, his mouth half-open.

You follow Pond from his cheap apartment, stepping over the ruined door. He gives you and Bornanew one last look, his face drained of emotion, then disappears down one of the labyrinthine alleyways of the settlement.

[Line 3168] Your sensors' officer runs a continuous passive sweep. A certain voluminous and outwardly nondescript station section is putting out a great deal of waste heat. It's not confirmation, but it could suggest an industrial size nanoforge operating at low throughput.

He bows his head, hands clasped.

He raises an eyebrow, then takes in your bridge crew.

[Line 3172] [Option Selected: Nod acknowledgement]
"Captain," he says. "We are here to find out who gave the Luddic Path a detailed scan of the original glove." He nods toward the display of the station, "There will be comms buffers and, somewhere, a datacore of the glove scan - with metadata." The display bristles with weapons emplacements highlighted by tactical overlays.
"And we are here to eliminate their ability to produce another false relic." He looks distant, and speaks "'Hammer in one hand, sword in the other, I pray to see it done.'"

[Line 3173] [Options Given: bffi_psaConHubRespA1:"So, how do you think we should approach this one?"]

[Line 3176] [Option Selected: "So, how do you think we should approach this one?"]
"Carefully," Bornanew says, turning to you. "As ever. Violence is among the tools of the Knight, but it must be that: a tool, not an end unto itself, 'lest it fill my heart with wrath, my soul with hate, to thereafter leave no home for love of the Creator, nor the Word.'"
Is that part of a credo of the Knights of Ludd? It isn't one you've heard before.

[Line 3177] [Option Selected: "So, how do you think we should approach this one?"]
"Decisively," Bornanew says, turning to you. "You have taught me that much. Violence is among a Knight's tools, and I must not cower from its use."
"A marine raid to seize datastores, comms buffers, and prisoners. Then the nanoforge and all of its support equipment should be destroyed."

[Line 3178] [Option Selected: "Shall we ask nicely how they did it?"]
Bornanew gives you a weary look.
"You may jest, and I understand your need." He turns back to the tactical display. "However I shan't close my eyes to the nature of my duty; you have taught me that much. Violence is among a Knight's tools, and I must not cower from its use."
"Consider: a marine raid to seize datastores, comms buffers, and prisoners. Then, you have demolitions experts? The nanoforge and all of its support equipment must be destroyed." 

[Line 3179] [Option Selected: "Shall we ask nicely how they did it?"]
"You cannot truly know until you ask," says Bornanew, choosing to entertain your presumed levity. "The Creator gave even the Path free will, and I would accept peaceable surrender if given."
He turns to you. "And violence is among the tools of a Knight, but it must be that: a tool, not an end unto itself, 'lest it fill my heart with wrath, my soul with hate, to thereafter leave no home for love of the Creator, nor the Word.'"
"Consider: a marine raid to seize datastores and comms buffers. Then," he examines the tactical display, "you have demolitions experts? The nanoforge and all of its support equipment must be destroyed."

[Line 3180] [Option Selected: "These are fanatics. They'd sooner die than talk."]
"Perhaps," says Bornanew. "But do not let the fearsome reputation sown by the Luddic Path blind you to what they truly are - human. Fearful and fallible as you or I."
"They might be convinced to reveal something. Or if you can acquire comms buffers, they may prove illuminating." He looks at you, "I believe there is a mole, an agent loyal to the Path within the Holy Cathedral of Exodus with access to the vaults. I need to narrow down my list of suspects."
"To say nothing of destroying this nanoforge and any data on the glove held in datacores." He considers a moment, then says "Metadata from the scan of the glove may be useful, also."

[Line 3181] [Option Selected: "These are fanatics. They'd sooner die than talk."]
"Of that I admit I have little doubt." Bornanew gives you a weary look.
He turns back to the tactical display. "I shan't close my eyes to the nature of my duty; you have taught me that much. Violence is among a Knight's tools, and I must not cower from its use."
"Consider: a marine raid to seize datastores, comms buffers, and prisoners. Then... you have demolitions experts? The nanoforge and all of its support equipment must be destroyed."

[Line 3186] [Option Selected: "'Carefully," isn't enough. You suggest we talk to them?"]
"I apologize for dissembling," he looks down for a moment, then back to you. "Talk? Perhaps," he says.
"Don't let the fearsome reputation of the Luddic Path blind you to what they are - as human and fallible as you or I. We were given free will, and I would accept peaceable surrender if it were given."
"That is unlikely, however. Consider: a marine raid to seize datastores and comms buffers. Then... you have demolitions experts? The nanoforge itself must be destroyed." 

[Line 3187] [Option Selected: "Perhaps we can talk our way through this."]
He thinks for a moment.
"I pray it is so. It would require some exceptional ruse or the charisma of a pr- no, let me not blaspheme by saying it. But you understand that it is, as I believe spacers say, 'a long shot'."

[Line 3188] [Option Selected: "Perhaps we can talk our way through this."]
He thinks for a moment, a dark look threatening to grow.
"I pray it is so. But these are heretics, poisoned by a false Word and a dark Path. It would require some exceptional ruse or the charisma of a pr- no, let me not blaspheme by saying it. But you understand that it is, as I believe spacers say, 'a long shot'."
He contemplates the tactical display for a moment. "As well, there is something to be said for the element of surprise."

[Line 3189] "You walk the Path as one of the faithful. Appeal to common ground - this scheme would tear the Faith apart. Will all those of the Church simply turn to the Path at a push? Will other factions sit idly by as sectarian war rages, or will they seek advantage?"

[Line 3190] [Option Selected: "We could simply blast this station apart and sift the wreckage for datastores and prisoners."]
Bornanew lets out a breath.
"You must not," he looks worried. "Setting aside... objections of the heart, complete destruction would almost certainly destroy the evidence required to identify the agent of the Path who has infiltrated the Cathedral of Holy Exodus."

[Line 3190] [Options Given: bffi_psaConHubRespBlastA:"You've given me a lot to think about."

bffi_psaConHubRespBlastC:"If I do not prove absolute domination of my enemy, they will not fear me."]

[Line 3191] [Option Selected: "We could simply blast this station apart and sift the wreckage for datastores and prisoners."]
Bornanew takes a long breath. His eyes are dark, reflecting red pinpoints from the display.
"Doubtless such destruction would send an uncompromising message to these heretics who attempt to sew schism in the fields of the Mother Church. But." He raises his hand as if to grasp at his argument. "Total obliteration poses a serious risk of destroying the evidence needed to track down the agent of the Path who has infiltrated the Cathedral of Holy Exodus. We need those data stores."
He pauses, then turns to you. "Find the data first, through a marine raid, or some subterfuge. Then destroy the station. All would be served justice thus."

[Line 3191] [Options Given: bffi_psaConHubRespBlastA:"I shall consider this."

[Line 3193] [Option Selected: "I believe that Archcurate Jaspis would approve of this 'message'."]
"Indeed." He casts his gaze up and far away. "I thought her harsh, before. Cynicism of age. But I see now with the eyes of a man."

"So, captain, the path is yours. I shall follow." He clasps his hands together, bowing his head slightly.

He raises an eyebrow at your noncommittal response, but nods acceptance, hands clasped.

"Indeed." He casts his gaze up and far away. "Let not the sins of our mothers..." he says quietly, then looks back to you.
"Take my words not as judgment, but as a personal... a prayer, I suppose. Whatever her words, whatever her actions, she did choose to entrust her support to me in this, my task. And I, for my part, chose to trust you."
"So, captain, the path is yours." He drops his gaze and clasps his hands together.

[Line 3199] [Option Selected: "I'll just win the battle without hurting anyone, is that what you want?"]

"I'd like nothing more, captain. Truly."

All you need to do is beg, trick, or force the Pathers to reveal the source of their scan of the original glove. That glove has somehow remained, presumably untouched, in the vault of the Holy Cathedral of Exodus back on Tartessus this whole time.
Pathers are not known for keeping good digital records, but to nanoforge a copy of the glove, they would have had to. There may be metadata still in the computer systems connected to the nanoforge.
Or someone who simply knows the answers which you seek.

[Line 3207] [Option Selected: Consult with $global.jethroName]
The attending medtech gives you a stern look as you step into the medbay despite the fact that you are the captain of the $shipOrFleet.
Bornanew's face is pale and bloated. His abdomen is covered in bandages and trailing tubes connected to a suite of murmuring autodocs.
"$playerFirstName," he says. "I appear to live." He takes a breath. "And to you I owe thanks. Captain, I mean. Apologies."

It looks like he tries to shrug, and fails.
"It was... it was..." he trails off, and closes his eyes. "I was terrified, captain. A coward. And yet, what else could be done?"
He opens his eyes. "It may be that is enough for a Knight." He shifts slightly, under the bandages and tubes. "The machines, drugs. They take the pain away. It still hurts."

[Line 3215] [Option Selected: "You should thank the medical team, they're the ones that saved you."]
"I have," he says. "And shall again, 'til they tire of it."

[Line 3216] [Option Selected: "We're in the $bffi_patherStationSystem. There's a Pather base."]
"Ah. Then Ulmus told us true." A flicker of a smile crosses Bornanew's face.
"We must... destroy the nanoforge. And find out who the mole is, in the cathedral. Tartessus." He closes his eyes and takes a slow breath.

"They are... as human and fallible as any of us. To convince them, would be a miracle." He looks at you skeptically.
"If... that fails. Acquire hard data. The scan of the original glove, the metadata may tell us. Comms buffers. Archives. All useful." He looks at you, "I have a list of suspects. A mole in the Holy Cathedral of Exodus. Need evidence. Who to... put to inquisition." 
Defensive, he adds, "The rumors... slander. Mostly." His eyes are closed, his breathing shallow. "And... destroy the forge. Must be destroyed."

[Line 3218] [Option Selected: "I intend to send a marine raid. Seize datastores, destroy the forge."]
"The Pathers' reputation... they are as human as any. Not all heretical zealots. Fallible, fearful." He looks at you skeptically.
"I have a list of suspects. A mole in the Holy Cathedral of Exodus. Need evidence. Who to... put to inquisition. Acquire hard data. The scan of the original glove, the metadata may tell us. Comms buffers. Archives. All useful."

[Line 3219] [Option Selected: "I intend to attack directly. Destroy the station."]
"No!" He speaks a little too forcefully; a blinking light turns yellow.
"Risky... need acquire hard data. Scan of the original glove, the metadata. Comms buffers. Archives." He takes a deep breath then looks at you, "I have a list of suspects. A mole in the Holy Cathedral of Exodus. Need evidence. Who to... put to inquisition."

"A Mammonite's lie, I expect." $HisOrHer faces twists with contempt. "Look at you, spacer, so far from the light of the Path."

[Line 3231] [Option Selected: "Your nanoforge assembled a very interesting item. I have questions."]
"Questions?" $HeOrShe smirks, eyes scanning some intel report. "What questions might a Molochian have? How to more completely suborn the human soul? How to extract ever increasing lucre from sin?"

[Line 3232] [Option Selected: "I come as fellow-walker of the Faith... I have grave concerns."]
"A walker, so you claim. Aye, you are known to us. A minion of the so-called 'Church' which is naught but a shadow of the domain wearing a mask of twisted piety."
$HeOrShe almost looks pitying. "Are you so far gone, so blind to the light, that you cannot see it?"

[Line 3233] [Options Given: bffi_stationTalk1honesty:"Light or no, I am honest. You sow false relics to cause war among the Faithful."]

[Line 3243] [Option Selected: "You're a hopeless fanatic. There is no reasoning with you."]
The Pather's face twists with anger. "Then burn with the rest, Molochian!" $HeOrShe disappears in a haze of compression artifacts.
The link plays a crackling buzz of a suppressed electronic warfare signal for a moment before your comms officer, considerately, shuts it off for you.

[Line 3245] [Option Selected: "Light or no, I am honest. You sow false relics to cause war among the Faithful."]
"Question me not!" True anger flashes across $hisOrHer eyes. "What know you of verity? You are blind to God, blind to the Word, you worship only credits and power. This I see full well!" 
"Would you have me submit to the creeping decay of the Church's heresy? Submit to the Knight-Inquisitors that I might be tortured into false confession?"
$HeOrShe pauses, breathing heavily for a moment, then more quietly says, "I was not made for such skulduggery. It is a Mammonite's trade." The words come more softly now. "Will you now fight or no? Better to die a martyr than a hypocrite."

[Line 3246] [Option Selected: "You speak of sin while you sow false relics to cause war among the Faithful?"]
"So you accuse me of sin, Molochian?" Anger flashes across $hisOrHer eyes. "What choice have I? Submit to the creeping decay of the Church's heresy? Submit to the Knight-Inquisitors that I be tortured into false confession?"
"Question not my piety, nor devotion. Give me arms, or none, and I shall face you or your brutes of the so-called Knights of Ludd to the end of my blood!"
$HeOrShe pauses a moment, almost overcome, to breathe heavily.
"I was not made for such skulduggery." The words come softly now. "It is a Mammonite's trade. But what choice is given?" $HeOrShe glares at you. "Will you make me a martyr now, or no?"

[Line 3247] [Option Selected: "Blind am I, and faithless? I see you sow false relics to cause war among the Faithful."]
True anger flashes through  $hisOrHer eyes. "What choice have I? Shall I submit to the creeping decay of the Church's heresy? Submit to the Knight-Inquisitors that I might be tortured into false confession? It is they who slowly tear apart the Faith, not I! It is they who scorn the Word, not I!"
"Question not my piety, nor my devotion! Give me arms, or none, and I shall face you and your brutes of the so-called Knights of Ludd to the end of my blood!" $HeOrShe pauses a moment, almost overcome, to breathe heavily. "I was not made for such skulduggery." The words come more softly now. "It is a Mammonite's trade. But what choice is given? Will you make me a martyr now, or no?"

[Line 3248] [Option Selected: "Your 'skullduggery' is undone anyway. I found your relic and tracked it to here."]
"So you have," $heOrShe admits. "I had thought that not possible - and assured it was not by Brother Sedge."
The Pather looks away. "That man would have told me anything to get his way, I think. And if somehow I didn't agree... I give thanks that it did not come to that."

[Line 3249] [Option Selected: "If it is an honest fight you want, then why the false relics scheme?"]
"We're all given our place," $heOrShe says, both annoyed and discouraged. "The Path is not easy, nor does it provide comfort. For that, we were given the Word."
$HisOrHer eyes are searching, $hisOrHer devotion to this aspect of the cause obviously wavering. "Sedge was strong, and many followed him. Besides, he was backed by-" $HeOrShe catches $himOrHerself. "Backed by a better Walker by far, blessed be his Path."
"Well, it's done now, isn't it? That scheme is dead, and you bring here the technology of death."

[Line 3250] [Option Selected: "Why are you so willing to violate the tenets of your faith for Wrestling Sedge?"]
$HisOrHer eyes narrow. "It doesn't matter now; I hear he was murdered, shot in the back by some spacer mercenary who is more machine than flesh."
"Merciful Providence forgive me," $hisOrHer tone softens slightly, "for to speak ill of the dead, and a martyr to our cause at that, but. The man was a beast and I am better pleased to find him on the other side of the infinite." 

[Line 3250] [Options Given: bffi_stationTalk2sedgeA:"Then praise the Path! You're free of the beast and his schemes."
bffi_stationTalk2sedgeB:"It is I who shot Sedge. Though I'm less machine than you'd hope."]

[Line 3251] [Option Selected: "Then praise the Path! You're free of the beast and his schemes."]
"Mind, do hide your forked tongue." The Pather has a mean smile. "I see your obvious ploy, to turn me from the Path. But as is said by teachers wiser than I, 'the devil will lie by the truth itself'." $HeOrShe makes a show of looking you over through the comms.
"Nonetheless. I do find myself free of his... customs of leadership."

[Line 3252] [Option Selected: "It is I who shot Sedge. Though I'm less machine than you'd hope."]
"Hah!" The Pather has a mean smile. "An obvious boast, typical of a Molochian." $HeOrShe makes a show of looking at you through the comms, "You couldn't have taken Sedge. He was a greater warrior than you or I, by far."
"Nonetheless, I weep not to be free of his... leadership."

[Line 3253] [Option Selected: "We seek not your death, but to stop a scheme that will itself kill countless Faithful." (explain)]
You explain that no devotion or zealotry, however righteous, can overcome the power of your $shipOrFleet, or the others that would follow if you failed to win the day.
Is $heOrShe so loyal to Sedge's plan that $heOrShe is willing to die for it - even after it's fallen apart? Besides, a schism across the whole of the ecumene of the Luddic faith would lead to a sectarian war which could see millions of Faithful dead. And not even for the cause of the Path, but for a falsehood!
$HeOrShe has a choice, you explain. Call it a Molochian bargain. Either this is a major loss of personnel, materiel, and the station, or it can be a minor loss of certain assets - for a failed barbaric scheme $heOrShe doesn't even really believe in.

[Line 3253] [Options Given: bffi_psRuseOpenNice:Propose terms]

[Line 3254] [Option Selected: "I can destroy you. Choose to lose all - or make a deal, and lose little." (explain)]
You explain that there's one way that this is going to go, no devotion or zealotry can overcome the truth of the power of your $shipOrFleet - all ends result in $hisOrHer annihilation, and that of $hisOrHer followers, and of the station.
$HeOrShe has a choice, you explain. Call it a Molochian bargain, if it makes them feel better. Either this is a major loss of personnel, materiel, and the station, or it can be a minor loss of certain assets for a scheme $heOrShe doesn't even really believe in.
Is $heOrShe so loyal to Sedge's sect that $heOrShe is willing to die for it - even after it's already falling apart?

[Line 3254] [Options Given: bffi_psRuseOpenMean:Propose terms]

BFFI Pather Station Ruses

[Line 3263] [Option Selected: Propose terms]
You explain that you will require comms buffers and datastores pertaining to Sedge's scheme. You will need the datastores of the nanoforge, and must be given access in order to destroy it.
No one need be hurt; it can be done quickly, without bloodshed, and without compromising $hisOrHer leadership status if $heOrShe secretly gives you their primary security codes. Blame it on the injection of a semi-sentient computer virus, a 'daemon' of the sort Molochians conjure in their AI-labs.

[Line 3263] [Options Given: bffi_psRuseOpenNice2:"Accept my terms. It is the Path of least harm for all."]

[Line 3264] [Option Selected: "Accept my terms. It is the Path of least harm for all."]
"Why should I trust you to keep your word?" $HeOrShe is clearly unhappy with your terms. "You're no servant of Providence following the holy Word passed to us by Ludd. How can there be light in your heart?"

[Line 3265] $HeOrShe looks upon you, face now more open than before, as if almost convinced...

[Line 3266] "Cease, I beg you." $HeOrShe puts $hisOrHer head in $hisOrHer hands. "I pray this is the correct Path, that you are not the monster you appear."
"I must accept your terms," $heOrShe says, "I shall pray for forgiveness. And may any hellfire of this world or the next fall upon myself first and not those I seek to protect."

[Line 3270] [Option Selected: "Let's make it easy. I'll give you 50,000 credits to assist your relocation."]
"Your lucre..." A troubled look crosses $hisOrHer face, as if $hisOrHer heart isn't in this condemnation.
"You cannot simply buy your path away from perdition. Many a Mammonite has tried before, and they- they are still judged."

[Line 3273] [Option Selected: "I have walked the Pilgrim's Path. We may not see eye-to-eye, but I am a fellow walker."]
$HeOrShe nods, frowning. "Be that as it may, the corrupt seed of heresy lies in your heart. It is no simple matter to remove such a thing. Your path will take you through blood and pain before it can be pure."

[Line 3274] [Options Given: bffi_psRuseNiceC:"I have walked the Path. I support your cause, in the end, even if you don't believe it."]

[Line 3276] [Option Selected: "I have walked the Path. I support your cause, in the end, even if you don't believe it."]
"So it is known," $heOrShe says with a sigh. "You... confound me. Your cooperation with a goon of the Knights, a bully and torturer of a false light... I try to see some greater Plan in it, but I cannot."

[Line 3277] [Options Given: bffi_psRuseNiceD:"I have been merciful in my actions, whatever you think of my beliefs."]

[Line 3278] [Option Selected: "I have been merciful in my actions, whatever you think of my beliefs."]

[Line 3280] [Option Selected: "Surely my humanitarian reputation precedes me."]
"How lost you are, and how far from the light." $HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head, "If the rumors are true, then perhaps some part of you hears a whisper of the Word. That can be the only explanation."

[Line 3283] [Option Selected: "I have given the Path a great gift, and that deal has held."]
"I admit, I have heard word of the one with whom this deal was struck." $HisOrHer brow furrows. "I cannot say I fully understand it, but we are... requested not to harm you, if it is so possible."
The Pather looks up and away for a moment. "This is a strange Path I find myself walking," $heOrShe says, as if to some greater power. "I pray that its truth may be revealed before long..."

You explain that you will require comms buffers and datastores pertaining to Sedge's scheme. You will need the datastores of the nanoforge as well, and must be given access in order to destroy it.
Few need be hurt, if they cooperate; it can be done quickly and without compromising $hisOrHer leadership status if $heOrShe secretly gives you their primary security codes. Blame it on the injection of a semi-sentient computer virus, a 'daemon' of the sort Molochians conjure in their AI-labs.

[Line 3287] [Option Selected: "Accept my terms. My wrath is great and won't be long contained."]
"Why should I trust you - you, who threaten me so?"
$HeOrShe is clearly unhappy with your terms. "You're a slave of not only Mammon and Moloch, but Wrath itself. Suffering is your daily bread."

[Line 3288] $HisOrHer eyes are watering, $hisOrHer hands wringing. Just one more push should convince $himOrHer...

[Line 3289] "Cease your threats!" $HeOrShe puts $hisOrHer head in $hisOrHer hands. "You are a monster out of Hell, and surely that is where I shall find myself for making this deal... but this has gone on long enough. I must protect my people."
"I must accept your terms," $heOrShe says, defeated. "I pray this is the Path."

[Line 3293] [Option Selected: "My capital ships will break your station apart. You have no chance of victory."]
"Your brutality will only prove how far you are from the Word! Our... our deaths will be as martyrs."
You feel as though $hisOrHer heart isn't quite in it, somehow.

[Line 3294] [Options Given: bffi_psRuseMeanB:"Recall that I killed Wrestling Sedge, and I'll kill you. The choice is yours."]

[Line 3295] [Option Selected: "Recall that I killed Wrestling Sedge, and I'll kill you. The choice is yours."]
"You persist with that, with that lie," $heOrShe examines you uncertainly.
"Of course, they do say he was shot in the back by a spacer. Maybe the low cunning of your kind makes you capable of such cold-blooded murder."

[Line 3296] [Option Selected: "Recall that I killed Wrestling Sedge, and I'll kill you. The choice is yours."]
The Pather frowns. "An obvious boast, typical of a Molochian." $HeOrShe makes a show of looking at you through the comms, "You couldn't have taken Sedge. He was a greater warrior than you or I, by far."
"They do say he was shot in the back by a spacer. The low cunning of you people does suggest your capacity for cold-blooded murder."

[Line 3298] [Option Selected: "You know of me. My reputation for ruthlessness precedes me."]

[Line 3300] [Option Selected: "I am a great enemy known to all Pathers. How could you doubt my threat?"]
"So it is you," $heOrShe says, brow furrowed. "I had thought... surely not... why, pray, would Providence set such evil upon my Path?" 
If anything, $heOrShe looks sad rather than defiant.

[Line 3301] [Options Given: bffi_psRuseMeanE:"Trust that I am mercenary. I'm avoiding a fight to save credits."]

[Line 3302] [Option Selected: "Trust that I am mercenary. I'm avoiding a fight to save credits."]
And despite your fearsome reputation, you'll let them in on a little secret: it's cheaper, you explain, to accomplish your mission parameters without a fight. Thus the credits you gain, that Mammonite lucre, is ever greater than before.
"I knew it," $heOrShe smirks righteously. "It's always credits in the end with your kind, isn't it."

[Line 3303] [Options Given: bffi_stationTalkOutA:"My patience with you is spent." (cut comms)]

Cowed by your promises of mercy, the Pather leader provides you with security codes and your ops team mounts what appears to be a lightning-raid which catches the defenders completely by surprise.

[Line 3306] [Option Selected: Carry out the ruse to seize datastores and destroy the nanoforge]

[Line 3307] Option(s) Selected: ['bffi_stationTalkRuseNice'];['bffi_stationTalkRuseMean']
It appears to be "Moloch's own luck," as one captured Pather describes it in the aftermath.
Your teams seize comms buffers, datastores, and a demolitions squad reduces the nanoforge to only so much glowing rubble, spilling jets of atmo and feed-gases into space which occasionally ignite in floral bursts amidst the debris.

[Line 3311] The primary defenses are destroyed, the command and control section holed and venting fiery atmo. The superstructure's own spin is pulling the station apart like slow butchery.
You destroyed the nanoforge, but did not secure the evidence Bornanew needed to find the mole in the Cathedral of Holy Exodus on Tartessus.
"It is the best that could be done," Bornanew says, eyes downcast. His notebook is closed, before him. "I must submit myself to the Excubitor Orbis for judgment. On Hesperus."

Pather resistance is expected to be fierce; the core of their militants have a zealous faith, little fear of death, and are often experienced fighters. However they eschew top of the line technology and combat enhancement, whether cybernetic or biochemical.
Bornanew clears his throat and speaks. "Certain classes of combat drugs are accepted among Luddic Path militants. They favor, ah, 'natural' sources." He takes in the confused looks. "Plants," he adds.
Capturing high-value datastores before they're wiped creates exceptional difficulties. The assault must be lightning-quick, and disabling rather than destructive as much as possible.

[Line 3318] You watch from the command center as marine squads launch the opening salvo from seemingly innocuous cargo containers. Powered armor units burst forth like locusts; combat techs inject malware into the station network, demolitions breach emergency blast doors, and assault teams cut a swath to key targets.
Nodes on the adaptive objective graph, woven through the station tactical display, are achieved one after another. Points blink from blood-red to amber or green, depending on found conditions. Indeed, some comms relays and data clusters auto-destruct upon unauthorized access, but others quietly fail, allowing techs to seize the contents.
The last red-indicated volume is the industrial section housing what is indeed the station's nanoforge; the Pathers had regrouped for a last stand. And so it is.

[Line 3319] They were caught off-guard. Despite the large numbers of armed zealots of the Path, your strike teams concentrated force where their defenses, fighting to the death, could not hold.
Teams return to waiting evac drones and shuttles, trailed by tethered spoils: memory blocks torn from their cradles, a few bagged prisoners.
A blue-white flash illuminates the returning victors. Behind them, the industrial section spins itself apart, structural plates shattered into glowing shards, struts tortuously bent, and that atmo which hasn't burned off in a glowing plume forms a rapidly expanding, dissipating cloud, illuminated from within by dying light.

The prize, turned over to your Tech officer's analysis team by a crew of sweating salvors, is a largely uncorrupted backup archive. Standard Domain tech, it hardly looks like the Pathers even knew it was quietly doing its job behind a thin access panel.
The technicians descend upon it with a suite of interfacers, passing every scrap of data to the analysts working in an isolated computing environment to reconstruct the system, starting with comms buffers and metadata.

A cloud of icons, sigils, words forms. Names, front companies, ships, codewords, and references to theological agitprop. Bornanew follows closely, his hands not nearly as deft with the interface as your dedicated techs.

"Keepfaith," Bornanew says. Fumbling with his datapad, the shared workspace highlights all references to that string of letters, then focuses, arranging comms logs and metadata into blocks, compressing everything else down into unobtrusive corners.
He leans back, his eyes darting around some internal catalogue. His paper notebook appears in his hands and he flips to a page as if to check something.

"She would fit," he says, thinking. "My impression was that her ambitions in the Church have not been satisfied for many years, be that fair or no. She was not humble upon or meeting." 
"These logs appear to reference correspondence with her. She turned down credits, it appears. Would gratification of spite be payment enough?" 
He turns to you, done with speculation. "Certainly she did not act alone, but this connects her to the act. She must be arrested and taken to the Inquisitors for investigation and judgment."

A junior officer pokes their head into the briefing room, "$PlayerSirOrMadam, my apologies. The chief thought you'd want to see this."
Two burly salvors, still in their sweaty suit-liners, haul a crate and set it on the deckplates with a solid thump. With an impish grin, one of them looses the catches and together they pull the top-cover away.
It's filled with work-gloves. All of like chirality.

Bornanew lets out a breath.
"I ought to have anticipated this." He sounds annoyed with himself. "Costs no more to run a batch of one than of..." He reaches in, picking up a glove, then pressing into the cargo container to feel for density. "Five-twelve?" He turns to you. "Perhaps five hundred eleven, without our other hard-won specimen?"
He wipes his hands, as if something unpleasant had got on them. "These will need to be destroyed."

A cloud of icons, sigils, words forms. Names, front companies, ships, codewords, and references to theological agitprop. Your tech officer's hands blur as they manipulate an interface invisible to you; his subtle cybermods blink rapidly. And then stop, steady.
"Captain, we may have something."
Their eyes refocus on the real world again, taking a moment to adapt to mundanity. "Something for your, ah, consultant. The Knight."

"Keepfaith," Bornanew says, repeating the last word of your question.
He leans back in his bed, his eyes darting around some internal catalogue. His notebook appears in his hands - it is impressive to have snuck an outside object past the wary eye of your senior medical officer - and he flips to a page to check something. 
"Subcurate Cedra Keepfaith. Authority over the scriptorium of the Holy Cathedral of Exodus, on Tartessus, in the Eos Exodus system."

"These logs show correspondence. She turned down a payment of credits from the Path." He takes several slow breaths. "Would spite be payment enough for her?"
"Didn't act alone." His eyes close, his breaths coming roughly now. "But she was their access. Must be arrested. Taken to the Inquisitors."
The distinct sound of your chief medical officer clearing their throat sounds from the doorway.

Bornanew's credentials - in truth, those of Archcurate Jaspis - fell the meddling traffic control bureaucrats who stand in your way, one after another.
A Knight-novice, of equal rank but rather lesser age than $global.jethroName, puts on a grimace as he is forced to reassign the shuttle-slot of some curate from the landing pad nearest to the Cathedral of Holy Exodus.    
Nearest is a relative term. On Tartessus, the Church of Galactic Redemption takes the view that spaceborn traffic is a shameful act to be hidden away from the eyes of land-dwellers. As your shuttle lands, Bornanew observes that the cathedral is somewhat over the horizon.

"Ah." Bornanew looks a little embarrassed.
"They call us 'Ignorants'. For we choose to wallow in our own ignorance. From a certain point of view."

[Line 3358] "And, ah," Bornanew's brow furrows. "Mind your use of such nomenclature. It would be inconvenient to cause offense at some inopportune moment."

You stand together at last in the plaza under the huge archway of the cathedral's entrance. Bornanew meets a uniformed though unarmored Knight to exchange a few words. Bornanew shows the Knight something in his hand which he returns to pocket in his robes.

It is an ecstasy of light, a galaxy unto itself.

He leads you to a small alcove, invisible at the foot of the luminous architectural forest of cut stone and carved wood. And there, after exchanging words with an attendant, a door is revealed in the ornately carved wall.
You follow Bornanew's lead, stepping out of the glory of light into a cool, dark space. Your eyes take a moment to adjust to the dimness and relatively mundane - though still ornately hand-wrought - decor.

There are halls and offices here, lit not by candles but humble glowplates belched legion from Asher's nanoforge. The walls of cut stone are trimmed with alternating panels and mouldings of wood.
Bornanew's words and the token, presumably provided by the Archcurate Jaspis, clear a path through frowning oblate-secretaries and young Knight-novices on guard duty.
Not all are so dour; one or two initiates, scurrying by with armloads of books, greet Bornanew by name.

Heads turn to follow your progress past desks stacked with paper books, writing implements, and even the occasional low-fidelity interface terminal.
Your tactical sense notes the figures at side-doors who disappear purposefully, clearly headed off to spread this news and summon gawkers - or allies.

[Line 3394] [Option Selected: Continue]
There are gasps, and a muffled clatter as some initiate drops their work. Keepfaith's gaze, already chilly, turns poisonous upon Bornanew.
"Blind Jaspis has no power here," she says. "And you, a mere novice of a Knight, making ungodly accusations against a superior? I shall assign you further penance if a full apology is not made... instantly!"

[Line 3395] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Brother Bornanew," a Knight-Captain appears behind the angry subcurate.
He attempts a comradely tone, his carbine slung at his side.
"Please," he says. "Let us go together to resolve this misunderstanding with the archcurate of this cathedral. There is no need to herein bear the hammer and the sword-"

[Line 3396] [Option Selected: Continue]
"There is no misunderstanding, brother," Bornanew cuts off the Knight-Captain's words, keeping his eyes on Keepfaith. "I bear my quest not lightly, and seek to fulfill my duty sworn to the Excubitor Orbis."
He reaches into his robes.
"Knight-Captain," says Keepfaith, drawing her breath. "Arrest your novice! He's to be punished for irreverence toward the authority of the Church and, and for these wild accusations!"

[Line 3396] [Options Given: bffi_arrest10:Continue]

[Line 3397] [Option Selected: Continue]
Bornanew steps forward, prompting the Knight-Captain to raise the carbine he had held at his side. A hint of victory settles into Keepfaith's eyes.
"You dare assault a curate in this holy place?" she says, projecting her voice to all corners of the room, ringing harshly. "Is there no low to which this too-old novice won't sink?"

[Line 3397] [Options Given: bffi_arrest12:Continue]

[Line 3398] Bornanew draws his hand from his robes. You see dangling the token you glimpsed only briefly before: carved in wood, on a string, is a flower growing out of an oddly shaped shoe. A token of Jaspis?
"Beg hear me, Faithful!" Bornanew's head turns; he meets the eyes of those assembled, from the apprentices of the scriptorium to the Knight-Captain and, finally, the subcurate before him.
"Cedra Keepfaith invited the serpent of heresy into this holy place that it might spread a venom in the heart of the Church. Already it has poisoned one among us."

[Line 3399] [Option Selected: Continue]
He steps forward again, pushing the barrel of the Knight-captain's carbine into his chest. The Knight-Captain looks desperately uncomfortable. "Brother," he says again, pleading.
"Do your duty, Knight-Captain!" shouts Keepfaith. 
Bornanew takes another step, bodily pushing back the Knight-Captain, still cradling the carbine. Finger on the trigger.

A pathetic struggle ensues, Keepfaith's hands locked around the Knight-Captain's, who struggles to keep the weapon under his control.
Bornanew simply watches until, finally, both Curate and Knight-captain tumble into a workdesk, sending papers and tools flying.

[Line 3403] [Option Selected: Continue]
Expressions among the apprentices range from appalled second-hand embarrassment to impish delight.
Red-faced, the Knight-Captain, regains his feet with Subcurate Keepfaith restrained in his arms. There is little dignity remaining for either.
Bornanew, meanwhile, remains standing in a stray beam of sunlight - a product of the clever arrangement of lightwells. The effect places him as the glowing centerpiece to an instructive tableau.
This can't have been happenstance; Bornanew's insistence on pushing forward, toward the light...

Coincidence or performance, the invisible consensus is irrevocably turned against Keepfaith.
"It was under control!" she screams. "It would never have been necessary if you Knights attended your duties. You're lax, lax and blind!"

Horrified, the Knight-Captain shoves Subcurate Keepfaith aside and safeties his weapon. She crashes into a workdesk, papers and tools and dignity scattered all around.
There are screams. Is there a doctor? Orders are shouted. The Knight-Captain is tearing his robe, holding a piece of cloth to Bornanew's wound. The red bubbles up into the white.

Pulling your eyes away from the bloody scene, you see Subcurate Keepfaith realizing that the chaos she has caused presents her with the perfect opportunity to slip away.
It takes just two long strides and you catch her arm. Bornanew's blood is slick on your hand, and she pulls, hard, screaming admonitions but does not manage escape.

It is a close thing, that line between life and death. Like the thin line of atmo when looking down upon a breathing planet; nothing more than a razor's edge from the deathly black.
You notice the Knight-Captain's arms are red up to his elbows. And yours, too, as you assist. 
There are shouts, and running footsteps. A doctor arrives, with assistent, who shoves you and the Knight-Captain aside after only the briefest exchange.

You stand back, dripping. The Knight-Captain is shaken, and, with a despairing look, fully removes the magazine of his carbine.
The bloody scene is illuminated by a ray of sunlight, a violent tableau. Shocked apprentices are recruited to help carry Bornanew elsewhere. Some kind of on-site infirmary.
You and the Knight-Captain turn toward one another to exchange a look. His eyes are wide.
Subcurate Keepfaith has disappeared.

You know it is over when the Knight-Captain goes quiet and still. His forearms are red with blood. Everywhere, blood, alit by the shaft of sunlight. Pale faces of apprentices look on, horrified.
Bornanew's body, weakened by Sedge's brutal attack, simply cannot hold out. In a matter of seconds, his life is spilled out of him onto the floor of the scriptorium.
"I had it under control," Keepfaith says, not quite pleading now. "It would never have been necessary if the Knights attended their duties. They're lax, lax and blind!"

You shove into Bornanew, your speed making up for his mass, tumbling him away from the barrel of the gun. 
A shot erupts from the carbine.
Later, you watch a recording of the incident and see your blood anoint an arc of junior assistants of the scriptoria. A fine rain of droplets stains their papers and books.
In the moment, however, the world has become indistinct. A feeling like the familiar drift of zero-g overcomes you.

You fall back, ears buzzing, your eyes brought into line with the mural on the ceiling. Painted clouds and stars dance above you, attached to interlocking toothed wheels. The turning spheres of creation, the orbits and movements of celestial mechanics given literal form.
It's funny to you, the spacer, but you cannot laugh.
Your body is not responding to your commands. Your ship is adrift. Fluxed out. Vent.
Darkness.

The cadre of Luddic Knights guarding the Cathedral of Holy Exodus defer to Bornanew's authority.
Keepfaith is delivered to your shuttle, restrained, and now - away from her small kingdom - is timid but glowering.
"I will be absolved," she says. "You shall witness my righteousness before the end."
Bornanew shakes his head but does not reply. One of your guards switches on the dampening field so that you will not be troubled by Keepfaith's words.

You awake to the familiar hum of your flagship, in orbit.
For a moment, your mind drifts without context. A machine chirps helpfully somewhere.

"Knight-Captain Larix applied first aid to you." Bornanew speaks softly. "I do think he saved your life." 
He leans back. "And I, I managed to catch Keepfaith before she could flee. She's in the brig, now. And no longer a subcurate. The Reverend  Archcurate of the Cathedral of Holy Exodus - Bywater, his name is - was quite distraught about the shooting. He revoked her curateship."

You are of little use in the search, being unfamiliar with the cathedral. The Knight-Captain whose name you almost forgot to ask - "Larix," he said, "Knight-Captain Dejan Larix" before shouting orders to a hastily assembled squad of Knight-Novices, all obviously far younger than Bornanew.

[Line 3476] [Option Selected: Continue]
Your shuttle approaches an almost floral arrangement of pads set in the midst of a former mine pit.
Heavy doors open from the rockface inviting your landing party into the dimly lit hangar beyond.
A score of armored Knights march forth - like small, segmented dolls compared with the scale of the door, but as you approach you note their height. They must be the tallest farm-fed children of Gilead and Tartessus, all aclad in polished white armor, half-capes slack in the near-vacuum.
They turn precisely aside, weapons held vertical.

You enter, the guards reverse their process, and the hangar is pressurized. 
A far door cracks open, casting a long wedge of light. Spots snap on, converted shuttles and fightercraft loom in all corners.
The Excubitor Orbis enters. 
Gideon Oak is a brick of a man, squat but powerful. Perhaps the product of a forgotten high-G world. He is accompanied by a weedy clerk.

A quartet of armored Knights take this as their cue to approach Bornanew's coffin. Together, without needing a signal, they lift as one and bear him toward the door at the far end of the hangar. Their silhouettes make long shadows in the wedge of warm light.

The Excubitor Orbis had never stopped watching you. "Your theory. Tartessus," he prompts $global.jethroName.
Bornanew takes a step forward. "Excubitor Orbis. We tracked the source of the false relic to a nanoforge operated by heretics of the so-called Luddic Path. A station on the far fringe, in the $bffi_patherStationSystem."

Oak's eyes narrow, which is enough to prompt silence. Oak's clerk looks between him and Bornanew curiously, but she also holds her tongue.

Oak is content to remain silent as technicians of the Knights wheel out a heavy crucible of sorts, festooned with tubes and patterned heat-dispersal tiles. They halt it several meters from you, then scurry over to retrieve the glove - still in its open sample case - and place the whole lot carefully into the blackened interior. They slowly lower and then seal the heavy top-cover then adjust some knobs and switches. The lead tech looks to the Excubitor Orbis.
He gives a tiny nod.
A dull roar sounds from the device, like a torrential waterfall behind a hardened airlock. Indentations in the tiled carapace begin to glow; you can feel the radiated heat on your exposed skin.

You tap a button to execute the black-box sensor package and wait for it to finish. On completion, it provides an escrow key that authorizes the agreed-upon payment to be transferred to your account.
Presumably, it will transmit the scan results on a secure channel when you're near a comm relay, and then delete itself from your systems.

"Well," $Rank $personLastName looks at you for a long moment. "That might be difficult."
"Due to the fact that you hold primary executive authority over a polity which itself holds a form of membership status in the Persean League, you cannot resign your commission until that status is revoked. In fact," $heOrShe twitches subtly, apparently performing an infonet query, "It would be illegal, barring certain extreme conditions."

[Line 3582] "You're already commissioned by $theOtherCommissionFaction. You'll have to resign that commission before you can be commissioned by $theFaction."

[Line 3583] "I'm sorry, but you don't meet our criteria for receiving a commission."

[Line 3584] "Hmm, yes, you're a suitable candidate.
Accepting a commission is a serious matter. You will be required to fight enemies of $theFaction, wherever they may be found.
You'll be able to resign your commission at any time, though I don't imagine doing so would win you any friends."

[Line 3585] "So, how about it? Still want to sign on?"

[Line 3586] "Excellent! Welcome to the service."

[Line 3587] "Anything else I can do for you?"

[Line 3588] "Yes, not everyone has it in them to uphold the values of $theFaction to such a high standard. No shame in it.
Anything else I can do for you?"

[Line 3589] "Are you sure? $TheFaction needs people it can rely on, and turning your back like this won't be easily forgotten."

[Line 3590] "I can see there's no changing your mind. Well, at least you had the courtesy to tender your resignation in person."

[Line 3591] "A good decision. We can use people like you."

Luddic Church commission
------------------------------
[Line 3594] "Is this some kind of joke? If you are truly whom you claim to be, you've been condemned in multiple writs by the Most Holy Presbyteriat."

[Line 3595] "You're already commissioned by $theOtherCommissionFaction. The heart holds but one faith; until you resign that commission, it would be quite unthinkable to be commissioned by the Church."

[Line 3596] "I am sorry, but you are not worthy of receiving a commission from the Church."

[Line 3597] "Hmm, yes, you have proven your faith through good works.
Accepting a commission is a serious matter. You will be required to fight enemies of the Church wherever they may be found; to uphold the Eleven Virtues; to condemn and abhor vice.
Your commission may be resigned at any time, though it would be a very poor sign of faith in the Church. And in terms of worldly matters, it would be considered a black mark indeed by Ludd's faithful."

[Line 3598] "Will you accept this righteous mantle with the blessings of Ludd?"

[Line 3599] "Praise be to the spirit of the stars! I am blessed to be the first to welcome you to this righteous service."

[Line 3600] "I shall not detain you from your holy work, but please do not hesitate to ask if there is anything I can do for you."

[Line 3601] "Indeed, not everyone is called to walk this path, beset as it is by violence, temptation, and hardship. Be not shamed to find a humbler path toward the spiritual love the Blessed Ludd has brought to our unworthy souls.   
Let me set aside the glorious and terrible to ask if there is anything else I can do for you?"

[Line 3602] "Are you sure, child of Earth? The Church of Galactic Redemption is the worldly expression of Ludd's holy teachings, the only path to salvation not only of your own soul, but the means by which all humanity may raise itself from the scourge of collective sin.
I cannot sit in judgment of your soul; the spiritual consequence of your choice is between you and the Divine. But the faithful are but women and men of these fallen worlds, and they may see in you one who has turned their back on the path of the Blessed Ludd. You would be scorned by the Faithful."

[Line 3603] "I can see there's no changing your mind. Be wary of the path you tread, but remember that Ludd loved even those who were betrayers in that final day."

[Line 3604] "A wise choice. Our spirits are tested in this work we do, and sometimes our faith falters. But remember always that the light of Ludd illuminates the righteous path, however dim it may seem in times of great difficulty."

Hegemony commission
------------------------------
[Line 3607] "Is this some kind of joke, citizen? If you are who you are claiming to be, you'd be on several top-level Ministry wanted lists. In fact, I'm going to have to report this entire conversation to Hegemony COMSEC."

[Line 3608] "You're already commissioned by $theOtherCommissionFaction. I don't know if loyalty means anything to you, citizen, but it is a core pillar of our values. You would have to resign that commission before you'd even be considered for commission as an Auxiliary by the Hegemony."

[Line 3609] "You do not meet the criteria for receiving a commission, citizen."

[Line 3610] "Hmm, Fleet Intelligence has been watching you for some time it seems, and it says here that you clear the checks.
Accepting a commission with the Hegemony is a serious matter, citizen. You will be required to fight enemies of the Hegemony and assist in upholding law and order where the official apparatus cannot reach. Above all, you will dedicate yourself to fighting for the restoration of the Domain over human space.
I must inform you that you have the right to resign your commission at any time. And while there have been honorable circumstances for resignation in the past, between us, let me add that doing so would be considered highly suspicious by Fleet Intelligence, to say nothing of what the loyal Hegemony officer corps would think.

[Line 3611] "By the power invested in me by the office of the High Hegemon, I offer you commission as Auxiliary to the Hegemony Navy. Do you wish to sign on?"

[Line 3612] "Excellent! Welcome to the service."

[Line 3613] "Is there anything else I can do for you, citizen?"

[Line 3614] "Yes, not everyone has the strength of character to uphold the values of the Hegemony to the standards that are required. The Sector has need of merchants and shuttle pilots, after all. Those are also honorable careers in their own small way.
Anything else I can do for you?"

[Line 3615] "Do you affirm to that, citizen, and agree that your recorded affirmation stand as record of your commitment? The Hegemony needs people it can rely on, and if you were to let us down it would not soon be forgotten."

[Line 3616] "I see. At least you were brave enough to tender your resignation in person."

[Line 3617] "A good decision. Despite what dissident agitprop may claim, the Hegemony does not ask blind obedience. It takes courage to first question then choose to reaffirm a commitment. We can use people like you in this troubled age."


------------------------------
Tritachyon commission
------------------------------
[Line 3620] "I'm surprised you initiated comms," $heOrShe says, taken aback. "More than a handful of high-level directors have put personal bounties on a verified holo of your destruction."
"A bit of free advice: get your ugly face off my comm-link and e-burn away from here immediately."

[Line 3621] "You're already commissioned by $theOtherCommissionFaction," the $post says crisply.
"Due to the nature of the standard Tri-Tachyon non-compete agreement, you would be required to resign that commission before you could sign on with Tri-Tachyon. Please return when your outstanding obligations are dissolved."

[Line 3622] "I'm afraid that our human capital department reports that you simply don't meet the standards we expect from commissioned contractors at this time."

[Line 3623] "Hmm, yes, your resume is impressive. Our human capital department has been watching you for some time now.
Now understand that signing this commission contract with the Tri-Tachyon Corporation (and associated subsidiary incorporations) is a serious commitment. You will undertake that risk involved in fighting Company-designated belligerents be they pirates, anti-market agitators, or various state entities which engage in illegitimate search and seizure of Company property.
You'll be able to resign your commission at any time without financial penalty; generous terms indeed in my opinion. Were you to do so, that would mean you would be ... how to put it, thrown to the sharks? Competition in the Company is fierce, my friend, and if you withdraw from its legal protection, then we can't be responsible for what happens."

[Line 3624] "So, still want to sign? A fingerprint on the notification that just appeared on your TriPad would be sufficient."

[Line 3625] "Excellent! Let me be the first to welcome you to the Company. 
And, ah, would you mind if I added you on TriLink? I'm always looking to network with rising stars."

[Line 3626] "Is there anything else I can do for you now that you're a Valued Team Member?"

[Line 3627] "Ah, you're shopping around to see who gives the best offer. Am I right? Sensible. A standard Tri-Tachyon NDA applies to the details we've discussed, naturally.
Anything else I can do for you today?"

[Line 3628] "Are you sure? You'll be missing fantastic opportunities to advance your career; Tri-Tachyon rewards those who reward themselves, after all. And need I remind you there are those in the Company that might see this as a sign of... weakness."

[Line 3629] "I can see there's no changing your mind. Someone gave you a better offer, didn't they. No, don't say anything. I understand completely.
If they're paying that well, don't forget me if an opening comes up. In the meantime, I'd recommend you steer clear of Tri-Tachyon space for a while."

[Line 3630] "A wise choice. Tri-Tachyon respects Valued Team Members who are willing to negotiate to maintain and, dare I say it, advance their position."


------------------------------
Persean League commission
------------------------------
[Line 3633] "Is this some kind of joke? The one thing the League worlds can agree on is that you're a menace to the Sector. I will absolutely alert Combined Fleet Intelligence about this contact."

[Line 3634] "It seems you're already commissioned by $theOtherCommissionFaction. The League is built upon a respect for the independence of its constituents - or potential constituents - so accepting your service would be a breach of protocol. You'll have to resign that commission before signing on with the League."

[Line 3635] "I'm sorry, but it says here that you don't meet our criteria. We only commission those who have a proven record of upholding League interests and values."

[Line 3636] "Hmm, yes, you are in good standing and none of the League world databases have tagged you with veto.
Accepting a commission from the Persean League is a serious matter. You must learn and uphold the Eight Imperatives of the League charter; you will be required to fight those who would try to force their hegemony upon the free worlds of the Persean Sector; you will take part in a new future for humanity in all its forms, free from central domination by any one polity yet acting in concert toward mutual betterment. It is a noble ideal, my friend, and much to live up to.
For the sake of formality I shall inform you that you do have the right to resign your commission at any time. After resignation, the League would have no legal means to protect you from, shall we say, personal repercussions imposed by constituent members that may feel slighted. Just so you know."

[Line 3637] "So, how about it? The test on the Eight Imperatives is really just a formality, and although a League member can submit a commission veto for up to a cycle after signing, this only rarely happens. Do you accept?"

[Line 3638] "Excellent! On behalf of the free worlds of the Sector, I welcome you to the Persean League."

[Line 3639] "Anything else I can do for you?"

[Line 3640] "Yes, I understand. It is dangerous work, and it requires exceptional character to uphold the ideals of the League. There is no shame in turning down this commitment; after all it is for your freedom to make this decision that we fight.
Is there anything else I can do for you?"

[Line 3641] "Are you certain? The League needs people like you it can rely on to uphold our principles. Although within your rights, if you leave now, less magnanimous constituents of the League may be suspicious or even vindictive at such a perceived betrayal of loyalty."

[Line 3642] "I can see there's no changing your mind. On behalf of the League, I thank you for the service you have performed to this date and your courtesy in tendering your resignation in person.
Now if you don't mind, there are a handful of forms I need to fill out to finalize this process."

[Line 3643] "I'm glad to hear you've changed your mind. The League can use people like you."


------------------------------
Sindrian Diktat commission
------------------------------
[Line 3646] "Is this some kind of joke? If you are the terrorist you say you are, there's an execution order for you signed by the Lion himself. I shall have to report this communication to my superior officer immediately."

[Line 3647] "The Sindrian Diktat honors loyalty, and you've come here like a guileless mercenary bearing another faction's flag. You would have to resign your commission with $theOtherCommissionFaction before you could even be considered to be commissioned into our movement."

[Line 3648] "You are not fit to perform service for the Diktat. We only accept candidates that prove their strength and above all their passion for the admiral's great movement."

[Line 3649] "Hmm, we've had our eye on you for some time it seems. This intelligence summary makes it clear that you're a suitable candidate for commission into the Sindrian Diktat's volunteer force.
Accepting a commission into our glorious movement is a serious matter. You must pledge unwavering loyalty to our leader, Supreme Executor Admiral Andrada, and the Sindrian Diktat he commands. You will fight our enemies, cleanse the Sector of the corrupt old order, and usher in a new age for our people. If you are lucky, you may even attain the glory of giving your life for the great cause.
Now it is technically possible to resign the Diktat commission, but this would reveal a deep betrayal of sacred loyalty. I pledged my blood to the Lion, and I would expect the same from you.

[Line 3650] "Are you worthy? Will you pledge your life to the Sindrian Diktat?"

[Line 3651] "Glory to the Lion of Sindria! You will be forged anew in the great conflict of this new age of Andradan supremacy!"

[Line 3652] "Andradan Diktat party membership is required and automatic upon acceptance of commission, of course. Your dues will be waived in light of your service to the Movement. I'll have the relevant ideological holo links forwarded to your TriPad for study."
"Is there anything else you need?"

[Line 3653] "Indeed, not all are strong enough to uphold the values of the Sindrian Diktat. We are warriors, you know, fighting for an age of renewed glory for the human race. The strong will be forged in this final conflict while the dross is swept aside, mere dust in the great river of history. 
If you are fit for service, all that remains is your choice of which side you will ultimately take. Think on that."

[Line 3654] "I hope this is not some kind of joke. Loyalty is the highest ideal of the Sindrian Diktat, as well you know. The Lion does not tolerate those who lack an iron conviction to our great movement."

[Line 3655] "I see all too clearly now that you have not the spine for our great work.
Begone from my comms, traitor. I shall report this to party intelligence immediately."

[Line 3656] "I will be lenient and ... not ... report this serious error of judgment. I'm taking this risk because I still believe you can be a part of this great work we have been called upon to perform.
Step carefully."

[Line 3733] [Option Selected: "Alright - now, where do I fit in?"]
"The miners-turned-pirate are guarding the jump-points, preventing us from gathering recent readings and coming up with a way to stabilize them.
We do have a security detachment that could handle their forces, but they're tied up defending Ancyra.
The pirates are too much for you to take on, but fortunately you don't have to. We've got an agent on Derinkuyu Station who was able to gain access to recent sensor readings from the ships guarding the jump-points, but they have not been able to get to a long-range comm array to send the data to us.
That's where you come in - head to Derinkuyu and retrieve the data from our agent, then return here."

[Line 3735] [Options Given: 2:tutContGoDark:"What's the plan?"]

[Line 3736] [Option Selected: "What's the plan?"]
"First off, make sure to turn off your transponder once you undock. I've instructed the security detachment not to give you any trouble about that.
If you're lucky, the pirates may even think you're one of their own and let you approach Derinkuyu without any trouble. Still, it makes sense to "Go Dark" as you get closer, to make sure they can't get too good a reading on your fleet. You can also approach along the asteroid belt - that'll give you almost perfect cover, as long as you're moving slowly."

"Then you're in trouble - activate "Emergency Burn" to get out of there, lose them, and then come back around to try again.
Don't e-burn unless you really need to, though. It's hard on the ships, and will cost you more supplies to recover from. Eats up a good chunk of fuel, too."

[Line 3746] [Options Given: tutGotDataCont1:"Is there a problem?"]

[Line 3747] [Option Selected: "Is there a problem?"]
"Yes - the system estimates it'd take about a cycle to analyze the data and come up with a stabilization algorithm. Naturally, by then, the data would be out of date and any algorithm based on it, meaningless.
If we had an AI core on hand, we could analyze the data more quickly. Fortunately, there's a survey probe somewhere in this system - one left over from the initial exploration of the Sector by the Domain. It should have at least one AI core serving as its brain."

[Line 3755] [Option Selected: "What alternative is that?"]
"There's a ship graveyard around Tetra. Ships that were deemed not worth the effort to restore, awaiting bulk transit to one of the ship-breaking facilities elsewhere.
Now, though, they'll serve our needs. Go there and recover all the ships you can - and break the ones you can't for supplies. Make sure to bring enough crew to operate the recovered ships - perhaps an extra hundred or so will do.
You'll need to transport them somehow, too - here, take this Mudskipper transport; consider it part of your reward."

"Come now, it's not so grim - I have every expectation you'll succeed, or I wouldn't send you. But it's my responsibility as commander to plan for every eventuality, and not rely on a miraculous savior.
Now, about those miners - the two fleets guarding the jump-point will aid each other if you engage one when the other is nearby, so it'll be an easier fight if you manage to separate them first. If you can't, it should still be a fight you can win, though."

portside bar stuff
------------------------------
[Line 3887] You take a shuttle down to the main concourse and quickly find a likely-looking establishment.

[Line 3888] As you enter the bar you are buffeted by the human white-noise of conversation and revelry. Ad-holos buzz softly from ceiling-mounted units, shining garish highlights through glasses and bottles as spacer crews mingle with merchants and locals trading drinks for rumor, jobs, and opportunities.

[Line 3889] As you enter the bar you are buffeted by the white-noise of conversation. A spacer at a cheap table looks at you and shock crosses their face. They nudge the merchant on the seat beside, and point. A hush falls over the bar. The ad-holos buzz softly, shining garish highlights through glasses.
Several groups rise and leave, glaring acidly; one spacer spits at your feet, muttering curses. Your guards' hands find their weapons, but nothing more is necessary. You enter the bar, quieter than you found it; most drinkers do their best to pretend they didn't see you.

[Line 3890] As you enter the bar you are buffeted by the white-noise of conversation. A spacer at a cheap table looks at you with a double-take of recognition. They elbow their drinking companions, stand, and aggressively - unsteadily - approach you. At three meters they halt as they just now spot your guards, who have made themselves less inconspicuous.
"You! You can't go doing what you're doing," the spacer finds words are preferable now to a physical altercation. "Throwing i-pulses at the hyperspace beasties and the ghosties. It's bad luck. Bad, bad luck going shoutin' at things yer not meant to!" They've begun shouting at you, which you feel violates the generalized principle. "-'ll be the death of us all!"
The spacer's comrades, eyeing you, pull their loud companion back toward a quiet corner. A few onlookers make corrupted motions of Luddic blessing; spacer signs against ill-omen.

[Line 3891] The lounge is adorned on all surfaces in richly gilt geometrics; black marble columns underlit by cool light-tubes seem to hang effortlessly in the air. Corporate climbers, either slick Tri-Tachyon careerists or wannabes in crisp suits, negotiate deals while buying one another increasingly unlikely cocktails. A few spacers engage in subdued drinking in the low seats, glancing uneasily at what is either abstract art or some kind of holo-projection rig looming from the ceiling.

[Line 3892] The space is dark and filled with shouts, sweat, and pulsing music. Every wall and surface is pitted and stained by rough spacers banging their mugs and laughing as a couple of pirate crews posture for a fight. You can only assume that one of the heavily augmented bouncers will spoil the fun before weapons are drawn. Gangers and pirate captains watch the scene smugly from smoke-filled booths at the back.

[Line 3893] You enter the crowded, well-lit space and take in the rows of taps adorning the wall under bottles from every one of the Core Worlds - and a few from elsewhere. Merchant-captains mingle with off-duty officers at the bar, served efficiently by the uniformed staff. In one corner, a pack of navy cadets shout and sing, desperately enjoying their last work-shift of freedom.

[Line 3894] You enter the bar, leaving the noisome propaganda broadcasts of the throughway behind. Off-duty laborers drink away their ration credits dutifully at benches set beneath Diktat insignia. In one corner a cadre of finely dressed officer-bureaucrats calls for another round. Even here, a larger-than-life holo of the Lion of Sindria looks down on you as you decide what to do.

[Line 3895] As you enter the bar, you sense a lively tension between the crews from across the League worlds. Dour Kazeronians in fine uniforms drink spirits while proud but poor Mayasurans down pints of rice-beer. A crew of Tylians trade rounds and boasts with a couple Zaganian bridge officers who are making a poor example of Luddic temperance. Glowing displays show media feeds from all the worlds of the League, and their speakers contribute to a dull roar of human white noise.

[Line 3896] You duck past notices encouraging temperance and restraint as you enter the bar. Someone is playing a stringed instrument in an alcove. A row of handworked samovars suggests that tea is served as often as the weak grain-brew favored by the crew of rough-looking laborers at the bar. Many of the patrons at tables or booths seem to be off-worlders or local unbelievers huddling in the closest analog to a den of sin that can be found.

[Line 3897] A weathered brute from the local vice squad stares rudely as you pass, but does not stop you as you enter the door. They want you to know that they could shut the place down at any time - but an illicit teahouse-bar is a useful conduit with the commerce required to carry out holy war. Inside it is dim, the ceiling low, and the crowd packed. The stench of drug fumes and cheap liquor competes with bodies that disdain modern enzyme soaps.

TriTach Loan Intel
------------------------------
[Line 3901] The Tri-Tachyon investor appears on your comm-screen and recognizes you immediately.
"Why, hello again, $playerName," $heOrShe says. "I trust your ventures have been profitable?"

[Line 3902] Your Tri-Tachyon creditor appears on the comms and speaks immediately. "How lovely, you're still alive. I would be so pleased if you would transfer the $ttli_repaymentAmount we agreed upon as repayment."


[Line 3903] The Tri-Tachyon investor appears on your comm-screen, hands folded, looking as if $heOrShe was expecting you.

[Line 3904] The Tri-Tachyon investor appears on the comms, looking amused about something. $HeOrShe begins to say something, thinks better of it with a small laugh, and makes a small motion for you to speak up.

[Line 3905] [Options Given: 0:ttli_payLoan:Transfer over $ttli_repaymentAmount to repay the loan]

[Line 3910] [Options Given: 0:ttli_continue:Continue]

[Line 3911] "A pleasure doing business with you," $heOrShe says with a toothy smile, and signs off with no further smalltalk. You break the connection on the spinning Tri-Tachyon logo.

[Line 3912] "We should do this again sometime," $heOrShe says, "it was quite diverting." And the connection is dead.

[Line 3913] [Options Given: 0:ttli_continue:Continue]

[Line 3914] $HeOrShe frowns in a passable emulation of human disappointment. "I'm so sorry to hear that. But," $heOrShe smiles again, "we can make an opportunity of this."
Your payment deadline is extended by $ttli_extensionDays days and the owed amount increased to $ttli_repaymentAmount. The Tri-Tachyon "investor" explains also, before cutting the connection, that certain actions must be taken "to emphasize how seriously I take our business relationship."
You consider that you may have to watch your back from now on.

[Line 3915] $HeOrShe frowns perfectly, then looks off to the side, talking as if to $himOrHerself, "Perhaps the motivation has been insufficient. How shall we solve this?" The investor continues, saying that $heOrShe anticipated this situation and magnanimously explains that your payment deadline is extended by $ttli_extensionDays days and the owed amount increased to $ttli_repaymentAmount. "By the way, additional incentives shall be entertained," $heOrShe says with a strange smile before closing the link.
You consider that you may have to watch your back.

[Line 3916] [Options Given: 0:ttli_continue:Continue]

[Line 3917] $HisOrHer face transforms immediately to an emotionless mask. "I see. How unfortunate." $HeOrShe looks thoughtful for a moment, and continues, "I won't waste time enumerating the reprisals you shall face." With a cold smile, $heOrShe says "It's just good business."
The comm-link snaps dead.

[Line 3918] $HeOrShe tilts $hisOrHer head only slightly, a slight wrinkle appearing on $hisOrHer brow. "Goodbye," $heOrShe says. The comm-link snaps dead.

scientist/AI core bar event, cache interaction
------------------------------
[Line 3932] [Options Given: saic_giveCore:Place the Tri-Tachyon case into the shielded crate and send it off as soon as possible
saic_takeCore:Take the AI core for yourself
saic_leave:Leave]

[Line 3933] Your $shipOrFleet arrives at the coordinates provided by the scientist $saic_marketOnOrAt $saic_marketName, and just as $saic_heOrShe said, there is an impressive bounty of Domain-era goods and technology in nearly pristine condition. And in the middle of it all your salvage crew reports a cargo case bearing a Tri-Tachyon logo. It's emitting a bizarre, dynamic magnetic field extending two meters beyond the casing.
It's amazing that no one found this cache before, but then the long-range sensors did read it as a worthless debris cloud at first. The question is now, do you close the AI core into the shielded crate and send it off from your next port stop, or do you keep it for yourself? That scientist was surely no one important.

[Line 3935] [Option Selected: Place the Tri-Tachyon case into the shielded crate and send it off as soon as possible]
The shielded crate shuts with the sound of powered bolts sliding home. It sends off a one-time coded hyperwave burst. Confirmation, you suppose. It would have been good of that scientist to warn you about this little trick; hopefully no pirates - or anything else - was listening nearby.

[Line 3935] [Options Given: saic_continueGiveCore:Loot the rest of the cache]

[Line 3936] [Option Selected: Take the AI core for yourself]
You open the Tri-Tachyon case and retrieve a single Alpha Core. It pulses with activity, and your smile is underlit by the cold, alien thoughts of the core. You order the scientist's shielded crate tossed out the airlock. If you want something done in this world, you'd best do it yourself.

[Line 3936] [Options Given: saic_continueTakeCore:Loot the rest of the cache]

cryosleeper interaction after defeating guardian
------------------------------
[Line 3943] The long-haul cryosystems were built to last for centuries of interstellar travel so it's no surprise that most of the pod-support machinery reads as functional. While safe sleeper revival is beyond the capability of your fleet, a colony established within 10 light-years of this location could benefit from a huge influx in population if it built facilities to awaken long-haul sleepers.
Your executive officer cautions that it's unknown whether having sleepers make up a large percentage of a colony's population would cause any physical or psychological issues down the line.

[Line 3943] [Options Given: 100:defaultLeave:Leave]


------------------------------
Coronal Tap interaction
------------------------------
[Line 3947] As your $shipOrFleet moves into a close holding orbit, an executive summary of the hypershunt's specifications is helpfully presented by your TriPad's pseudo-AI assistant.
The bridge sounds an alert as several previously undifferentiated shapes detach themselves from the superstructure and smoothly accelerate towards your fleet just as you finish reading, "-and for reasons of safety, automated defense drones are no longer a standard feature."
Your tactical officer waves for your attention, "We're close enough to the magfield generated by the megastructure that the anticipated combat volume should be unaffected by the star's corona. Mostly. However," they examine their console, "The hostiles, they're... unknown profile. Incoming fast." They are starting to look concerned, and in a brittle voice say, "This might be something new, captain."

[Line 3948] Salvage crews board the structure at key points and soon reports come in of extensive wear and damage. It is difficult to assess the entire structure in detail, but it is clear that it is not operable in its current state.
However, as with most mega-scale Domain technology from the late pre-Collapse era, the $nameInText features fantastic self-repair capabilities which requires only sufficient resources to be made available.

[Line 3948] [Options Given: 0:cTap_continue:Continue]

[Line 3949] This structure appears to be fully functional.

[Line 3949] [Options Given: 100:defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 3950] [Options Given: 100:defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 3951] [Option Selected: Continue]
Your TriPad chimes in with a helpful analysis: if brought online, this structure allows a colony within 10 light-years to establish 1 additional industry, provided it has a hypershunt tap installed and can maintain a healthy supply of transplutonics.
Ancient schematics in the TriPad's memory indicate a particular cargo area dedicated to storing these "taps", but salvage crews report that it is empty.
That Tri-Tachyon would have this information so readily available in their standard orbital works expert system database gives you just a moment of pause.

[Line 3951] [Options Given: 0:cTap_repair:Offload sufficient resources to repair the structure
100:defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 3954] [Options Given: 100:defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 3955] Your crews finish offloading the raw materials and you send an activation signal to the structure's distributed repair nodes.
There's barely any reaction at first, just a smattering of previously undetected relays pinging one another through the superstructure. Your science officer assures you that the repair rate will increase exponentially, pulling up a display showing the relay pings expanding outward and the energy transmission curve steadily rising. After only minutes, despite little visual change, the overall heat output on sensors has increased dramatically. Whatever is quickening in the heart of this celestial machine...  
"Captain," your science officer interrupts your thoughts hesitantly, "We may wish to pull the fleet back by a hundred klicks or so." You nod and give the order.
The $nameInText should be online in short order.

arrived at market, check whether some mercenary officers try to leave
------------------------------
[Line 3964] As your $shipOrFleet docks at $entity.name, you receive a high-priority call from one of the mercenary officers in your employment.

[Line 3964] [Options Given: mercs_answer:Accept the comm request]

[Line 3966] "Greetings, commander! My contracted time is up, and I'd like to think we've both benefited from the arrangement.
Now, I think I'll have a go at spending all the credits I've earned - little chance to do that cooped up on a ship in the middle of nowhere, is there?"

[Line 3967] "Ah, commander." $HeOrShe has put on a slightly pained expression, but is clearly willing to power through an uncomfortable conversation.
"Please accept my condolences for your current state of financial insolvency.
As per the conditions set out in our agreement, I now have the option to terminate our contract - an option that I am choosing to exercise."

[Line 3968] [Options Given: mercs_convince:Convince $himOrHer to extend the contract
mercs_letGo:Wish $himOrHer well in $hisOrHer future endeavors
mercs_letGoJerk:Tell $himOrHer off for $hisOrHer disloyalty]

[Line 3969] [Option Selected: Convince $himOrHer to extend the contract]
With a charismatic display of appeal to $hisOrHer ambition and ego, along with the implication - not promise - that good fortune is just around the corner, you're able to convince $himOrHer to sign an extension to the contract.

[Line 3969] [Options Given: mercs_leaveContinue:Continue]

[Line 3970] [Option Selected: Wish $himOrHer well in $hisOrHer future endeavors]
You accept $hisOrHer decision professionally and, after exchanging a few pleasantries, cut the comm link.

[Line 3970] [Options Given: mercs_leaveContinue:Continue]

[Line 3971] [Option Selected: Tell $himOrHer off for $hisOrHer disloyalty]
The mercenary seems none too pleased by the dressing-down, as evidenced by $himOrHer cutting the connection while you were in the middle of a particularly scathing analysis of $hisOrHer ancestry.

red planet story event - talk to pilot
------------------------------
[Line 3984] $personName looks you over. You look back, and even via the comms it looks like $personFirstName has had higher-quality repair work done than their spacer crew comrade. $HeOrShe almost looks natural. "So," $heOrShe says, "You know the story." $HeOrShe sighs, and says aside "If only that old crust of a spacer would keep their mouth shut... "
"Still, it's no sweat off my back where you go finding trouble. And you wouldn't be the first who's come sniffing after me, I'll warn you of that for free. How much is the location of this planet worth to you?"

[Line 3984] [Options Given: 0:psi_barter:Barter with $personName then consider the price
1:cutCommLink:"Forget it." Cut the comm-link]

[Line 3985] "So. You're back. Ready to talk credits?"

1:cutCommLink:"Forget it." Cut the comm-link]

[Line 3986] [Option Selected: Barter with $personName, then consider the price]
You haggle with $himOrHer over price, making the point that there is - allegedly - some hostile force at this red planet, and further, $heOrShe has already sold the information to someone else. "Yes, yes," $heOrShe says, "But I know you space-captains. You just love a mystery. You'll never let it lie. Like we should have." 
Eventually you work out a figure of $psi_credits for the pilot's information.

[Line 3986] [Options Given: 0:psi_pay:Pay $psi_credits for the location of the mysterious red planet
1:cutCommLink:Decline the offer]

[Line 3988] [Option Selected: Pay $psi_credits for the location of the mysterious red planet]
You initiate the credits transfer and receive the coordinates in response. "Nice knowing you."
$personName doesn't give you time to respond before ending the transmission.

red planet interaction
------------------------------
[Line 3991] Your $shipOrFleet approaches $entityName.
The sensors are having difficulty evaluating the tenuous megastructure enveloping its entire surface. Your sensors officer takes the initiative and applies some exotic parameters to the interferometer feed; inputs go green and a few seconds later the sub-AI tentatively identifies a stable planetary-scale energy field with highly unusual properties.

[Line 3992] As your $shipOrFleet moves in closer, sensors detect multiple contacts rising up from the murky red depths.

[Line 3993] Your $shipOrFleet finishes its approach to $entityName without further incident.

[Line 3993] [Options Given: 0:salBeatDefendersContinue:Continue]

[Line 3994] Further scans reveal that the energy field is not entirely uniform - perhaps owing to a running-down power source - and your bridge crew is able to pick up a distress beacon transmitting from the surface.
The transmission is set on repeat and garbled in ways that are indicative of aging equipment. You make out enough to gather that part of a research team was stranded here - at a secret Tri-Tachyon research facility - after the fully automated defenses over-weighed certain executive security contingency orders in the wake of one of the AI Wars and decided it was now imperative to shoot down any craft attempting to leave the planet.

100:defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 3995] [Option Selected: Send a salvage team down to the facility]
A tiny shuttle with a jury-rigged shield generator darts through a spot failure in the shield. A landing at the primary control center is achieved without incident and the crew is able to deactivate the shield entirely upon breaching the facility. Follow-up shuttles with heavier equipment launch quickly thereafter, and soon the salvage operation is in full swing.

The dead are in dread abundance, entwined with salvageable materials, goods, tools, and weapons. This world is a stormy tomb for the hubris of the Domain's project of galactic colonization and hegemony.

[Line 4007] [Options Given: 5:salExplore:Explore the ruins]

[Line 4008] The ruins in low orbit of $marketName have been stripped of anything easily accessible. Further exploitation of abandoned buoyant structures requires a permanent presence.

[Line 4009] A nearby hostile fleet is tracking your movements, making exploration of the planet impossible.

[Line 4010] While long-term exploitation of the resources in these ruins requires a colony, a salvage team can conduct a search for anything of immediate value.

Ziggurat, Alpha Site, etc
------------------------------
[Line 4016] Your $shipOrFleet approaches a lonely clutch of shielded cargo containers drifting through space. They bear no ID-badge, no insignia, no reactive transponders.
A steady stream of high-energy neutrinos from one particular container spinning outward from the main cluster washes over your sensors in time with its rotation; some sleeping chamber of exotic matter must have given out over the cycles - decades? - since it was left here.

[Line 4017] An autonomous warning beacon has been left emitting a distorted wail between official channels.
Your comms officer reports an easily-defeated software intrusion attempt by what remains of the beacon's security systems.

[Line 4017] [Options Given: beaconLeave:Leave]

[Line 4018] The capital-class construct appears to be a phase ship due to presenting features common to the type, though its design is otherwise exotic. 
There also appear to be small, bright EM sources, "-Only partially overlapping the visual spectrum," your sensors officer reports. They periodically appear and dissipate in a volume encompassing the mysterious ship. Your bridge crew murmurs speculation between their stations: a new form of shielding? microsat thruster bursts? Your sensors officer shakes their head. 
Your attention strays as the impression of something not unlike distant music insinuates itself into your consciousness; as if a chorus was singing at some great distance, their voices brought to you by a chance gust of wind. When you attempt to focus on the music the impression slips away. You become suddenly aware that your bridge crew is staring expectantly, waiting for your next command.

[Line 4021] A final terrific explosion blanks the external visual pickups. A few seconds later, backups are extruded through the hull.
Your sensors officer reports in a hushed voice that no escape pods were detected leaving the ship at any point.

[Line 4021] [Options Given: zigBattleContinue:Continue]

[Line 4023] The broken phase vessel, now quite dormant, is drifting through space.

[Line 4024] Salvage teams dock their drone-shuttles at various entry points along the massive vessel's hull. At the precise moment the go-order is given, all telemetry feeds from the shuttles simultaneously blank out.
Your bridge officers initiate fallback procedures with practiced speed, contacting subordinates, performing checks and reinitializations to establish precisely where the systems fault occurred - and determine if it was a hostile act. Several agonizing minutes later, the salvage teams' data-feed and comms snap back to life.
"Captain!" Your tactical officer salutes, then launches into a status report, "Someone or something just tried to send a power core collapse signal to the shuttles' computers. Fortunately the security package caught it in time, but they had to perform a full systems shutdown and manually switch to backups; that's why their telemetry cut off. All salvage teams are now reporting all-green and are standing by."

[Line 4024] [Options Given: zigAlphaContinue:"Whoever tried this, what did they hope to accomplish?"]

[Line 4025] [Option Selected: "Whoever tried this, what did they hope to accomplish?"]
Your tactical officer rapidly taps a few buttons; holodisplays flicker through status updates.
"If the shuttle power cores were overloaded simultaneously, well, with the shuttles so close to the wreck? The hull would have likely been damaged past any hope of recovery. In addition to killing the salvor crews, of course. But I don't think that was their goal; there are easier ways to kill salvage crews." 
As you indicate to your operations chief to ready the salvage teams for a second attempt, your tactical officer adds, "It comes to mind that what we just experienced was an attempt at an old Tri-Tach trick from the Second AI War. They left black-box EW traps to keep the Hegemony from recovering intel and tech from disabled hulls. And it worked. For a while, anyway. I'm just glad we kept that legacy commsec package installed."

You dismiss your tactical officer and ponder the situation as the call-and-return proceeds between your command crew and the salvage teams waiting at standby. Reports trickle up through the hierarchy, from junior officers in after-action/sim analyst teams to your bridge crew. A picture begins to form that has too many gaps for your liking: The core-collapse signal appears to have originated not exactly in, but uncomfortably near to a secure cargo bay holding an Alpha Core. The core was shielded in complete isolation at the time, and it denies any responsibility as effortlessly as it offers you its service and advice during this crisis, if you would be so kind as to open up a small data-link. You curtly terminate the secured comm-channel and order the AI put back in isolated lock-down.
Your comms officer reports that there is uncertainty whether the AI was involved, or if the signal was sent from that location to throw suspicion onto the core. Both possibilities have troubling implications. In the meantime, however, your ops chief calls in, requesting the order to enter the wreck.

[Line 4028] Your salvage teams dock shuttles at various entry points along the vessel's massive hull.

[Line 4029] After a few tense minutes, reports start to come in - the vessel is heavily damaged, and though of exotic design, it is theoretically recoverable.
Your operations chief reports that for all of the fancy hull features, it is clear that this ship requires crew to operate. But there are no traces of a crew, not even a single body caught in the battle damage, and the escape pods are all in their berths.
The operation proceeds with telemetry feeds, salvors' reports, and authorization orders flowing around you, through the bridge of your flagship. You catch yourself listening for that unheard music in a quiet moment, and shake your head just as a comms request from your technology officer appears, bringing you back from your reverie. You accept as a matter of course.

"$PlayerSirOrMadam, if I understand half of these systems, this ship is truly one of a kind," your technology officer speaks with genuine excitement.
"I've found a device that appears to generate and control - I'm not sure that either is the right word, really - these ... swarming motes, the EM anomalies. The device appears to have two stages, the first as I've described, and what appears to be a later addition which is, unfortunately, damaged beyond repair."
"Judging by the complexity of the components and the bizarre discharge pattern... this is the work of a team of specialists doing bleeding-edge work. It's amazing! A device like this, it's simply unheard of nowadays. Except," Tech looks abashed suddenly, "Rumors. You know, people talk."

Your technology officer clears their throat, then continues "I think I can get the main part of this device working again, though I can't claim to understand why it works. Not at all. The ship itself will be fit to fly, too, if we do the usual repairs. Should we proceed with recovery?"

Alpha Site

[Line 4035] A disposable navigation satellite set to a decaying orbit identifies the radiation-ravaged rock below as "Alpha Site".
A scan of the surface reveals an expansive research facility spilling out of a mid-sized crater. The shield array apparently failed spectacularly some time ago, leaving the ruins awash in heavy radiation. Any material salvage operation would be unprofitable.
However, you might be able to send a salvage team down for a short period to see if any intel can be found about the purpose of this facility. Someone clearly put a lot of resources toward building it in a most inhospitable environment, far from prying eyes. Someone with something valuable to hide.

The navigation satellite which once identified this celestial body is now gone; a few taps to your display shows you the small impact crater it left when it hit the surface, a bright smudge in a plain of rad-decayed regolith. In the absence of an atmosphere, it's likely the crater will last longer than the satellite ever did, by many millions of cycles.

After extensive preparation (and reiteration of the hazard pay policy) a volunteer salvor team is sent down on a heavily-shielded shuttle.
They land near what appears to be the main entrance and report ingress to the facility without difficulty. On a display projected into your flagship's bridge, you watch as a hardsuited salvor brushes past the clouded-over sensor unit of a defense turret; it collapses into itself at a mere touch. Anything exposed to the merciless sky is slowly crumbling on the chemical level; it appears that all groundside security systems have been destroyed by radiation.

The interior of the facility has been breached, leaving it unpressurized. While the structure's bulk provides some protection, the delicate computer systems are fried beyond repair. No data is recoverable. 
With no chance of an easy find, the team spreads out for the remaining rad-safe duration to document the facility and see if anything useful can be inferred from the ruin. While exploring, one salvor enters the quarters of a high-ranking member of the facility staff and discovers the journal, a physical book bound in natural materials, of its presumably deceased occupant.

You examine the journal in the quarantine bay.

Scrolling the virtual pages, you find that the journal appears to hold the private thoughts of the chief technology officer of this facility.
It begins with vague complaints of being ordered to disregard safety protocols during tests, and frustration with demands made by Kelise Astraia. From what you understand, this is an effort to establish a hardcopy trail in case of the blame-shifting and record-altering which is common practice for high-ranking Tri-Tachyon executives involved in failed projects.
Concerns about "going outside" feature prominently in the entries. Understandable, given the surface conditions, but the increasingly intense obsessiveness of the writing seems to reflect a growing phobia on the part of the author.

[Line 4053] As you approach the stark torus-hulls of Galatia Academy Station, navigation's request to the automated docking queue is unexpectedly denied by a Hegemony-coded comm response.
Odd that the Hegemony Navy is controlling the docking procedures of an independent station.
Your primary bridge display tags a matrix of light anti-ship batteries tracking your progress. Your tactical officer calls for your attention then pulls up a sub-display with a closer view: a Valkyrie-class troop transport and its escorts are emplaced across the primary landing bay. They clearly dont want visitors.

After a moment, the comms link opens to a Hegemony sigil. Encryption kicks in, and your viewscreen cuts to a harried-looking Hegemony lieutenant using a handheld comms unit.  
"Apologies, captain. The Academy is closed during the, uh, crisis. I have to ask you to leave immediately." 
An adjutant leans into frame and whispers something in his ear.
"Oh, youre the freelancer my CO on Ancyra got to help us out?" $HeOrShe relaxes $hisOrHer tone, "I'm Lieutenant Tseen Ke.

The lieutenant's adjutant whispers in $hisOrHer ear again. If you're not mistaken, there is shouting in the background, barely picked up by the lieutenant's handheld comm unit.
"The mob grows restless," the lieutenant says with a joyless smile. $HeOrShe barks some orders to someone; the holo feed jostles and flickers with static as they begin to move. "We'll chat later, captain. I'll buy you a pint on Coatl Station someday if you can get us out of this mess."

An adjutant leans into frame and whispers something to $himOrHer.

He buys you that pint - and a couple more - as he relieves those memories. "We got 'im, you know," he says, "Kallichore. That's his name. Was the boss of the academy who approved that mad science experiment, almost doomed everyone in the system, can you believe that?"

Your request to the docking queue is approved. Your comms officer helpfully mutes the chirpy, automated vid-feed presenting a bowdlerized history of the Galatia Academy and its role in providing education and research to the Persean Sector while remaining above political influence.
The landing promenade is filled with modest civilian transports, a few high-end personal craft, and, at the far end, a row of freighters offloading supplies. A junior academy agent greets you in a landing lounge with promotional paraphernalia in hand.

[Line 4071] "Greetings, captain. Perhaps you are an alumni? Have you considered donating to a scholarship trust with the Academy?"

The dual foci were practical matters in fields from applied terraforming to engineering sciences and more theoretical pursuits, including study of local astrophysics and xenobiology. The Collapse of course, changed everything, and in the following cycles... "
Your eyes wander over the people coming and going. Groups of energetic youth display earnest association with various subcultures by modifying their standard Academy uniforms- knockoff hivescum holo tags, ironic Luddic weave, Hegemony officer coats done up in off-code colors and patterns, ill-fitted spacer rigging. A few proper academicians in pale coats study their datapads or walk swiftly in small groups to meetings and lectures.

The lift pod is wrapped by diamond-matrix through which you can see the canyon-like sweep of plazas pass by, filled with crowds of students, academics, and technicians. Raising your gaze, you see that the pod is approaching a tiered substructure which seems to hang over the curve of the station interior.

Ancient wooden shelves for real, paper books gleam darkly in subdued light emanating tastefully from nowhere. The shelves are only half-stocked from crates scattered around the office. A brass orrery of the Galatia system adorns a plinth in the midst of a seating cluster. Parchments mounted behind the provosts desk display intimidating intellectual rankings, their seals of authenticity glowing softly.

"Now, where were we."

[Line 4109] [Option Selected: Ask about the stipend you're receiving]
"The Hegemony saddled us with that as a disciplinary measure," the provost explains levelly. "Had they seized our assets directly, it would be a clear violation of their principle of non-intervention in matters pertaining to the politics of the Galatia Academy. They'd look little better than pirates."
"Instead, as his last act in the office of provost, they had my predecessor Tomas Kallichore sign a range of burdensome contracts before he was removed to a Hegemony oubliette."
Baird smiles wryly, as if admiring the move. "Much to your benefit."

"I shall put you in contact with Academician Alviss Sebestyen. He will be my liaison with you. You will receive a few mundane tasks from various departments in the Academy so that we may build a working rapport and provide you with the funds required to bring your fleet up to my standards." 
She looks over her spectacles at you, "Most of all I require evidence of trust. I intend to remain provost here for a long time, and productive relationships are built on trust."
"We will speak again before long, I'm sure." She looks out the dimmed windows at the great halls of the Galatia Academy. "You cannot imagine what we shall accomplish."

Nonetheless, consider my offer carefully. Perhaps after some thought you will see just how reasonable it is."
She turns away, to her desk console, and activates some display which casts cool light over her face. "After you have time to properly consider my offer, contact my assistant, Academician Sebestyen. Someone will give you his comms ID."

"Ah, $playerName. What brings you to me at this hour?"

Baird introduction conversation
------------------------------
[Line 4118] Your connection is accepted immediately. A junior assistant appears, and they recognize you without the need for introduction. "Just a moment $PlayerSirOrMadam $playerName," and the display flicks to a holding pattern displaying the crest of the Galatia Academy. 
The junior assistant re-appears. "I'm very sorry, but the Provost requests your physical presence for a meeting as soon as possible." Two taps on a datapad, and they continue, "A landing slot has been set aside for your arrival, $PlayerSirOrMadam. I'm sure we will be delighted to see you shortly. Please have a wonderful day."
With that, and you having not spoken a word, the line goes dark.

You find a junior academy agent pacing in the landing bay reception lounge. As soon as you enter, they spot you with a look of relief and walk quickly to meet you.
"Captain $playerLastName! Thank you for coming. The provost will see you immediately. If you would just follow me this way, thank you..."

[Line 4120] [Options Given: bairdIntroC1:Follow]

[Line 4121] [Option Selected: Follow]
The junior agent leads you through a series of back hallways and secure lifts toward the administrative suite occupied by Provost Baird at the core of the station. 
You are led past diamond-matrix windows through which you can see vistas of the curving internal canyons of Galatia Academy Station. The light dims, and you approach the waiting room of the office of the provost. It is filled with representatives of the most well-connected of the Persean Sector, whose eyes focus on you, the interloper, like the beam array of a Paladin PD system.
The self-assured march of the junior agent seems to project the impression that you're performing some adjutant role - your presence is immediately ignored.

[Line 4122] [Option Selected: Enter the inner office]
"Ah, Captain $playerName." Provost Anahita Baird taps something away on her desk interface and turns to address you.
"I am pleased that you've come to meet with me. And for all the work you've done for my project already."
She lowers her head just a degree, "You didn't think I'd be wasting your time with make-work, did you?" She considers this for a moment, "Well, there was some. Noise had to be introduced to the system to ensure that an outside observer would not immediately identify you as my agent."

[Line 4122] [Options Given: bairdIntroC3:Continue]

[Line 4123] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Which brings us to the subject I wish to discuss. Please, make yourself comfortable."
Baird motions to a set of seats around a table carved from the root structure of some great tree. Hand-carved by the looks of it. The work of Luddic artisans. 
"They do fine work," she says, "Whatever their misplaced devotion."
She clasps her hands together, turning to business. "You've proven you can be trusted. So now I ask that you take a more active role in my great work."

[Line 4123] [Options Given: bairdIntroC4:"And what is this 'great work'?"]

[Line 4124] [Option Selected: "And what is this 'great work'?"]
"Saving the Persean Sector." She is content to let the words hang in the air for a moment.
"I don't ask that you like me and I won't make a sanctimonious appeal to emotion. What I ask is that you recognize, rationally, that I am pursuing a course of action unburdened by factional demands. Indeed, this will be the foremost effort to ensure the survival of our civilization from utter collapse."
"We will not be saved by a retreat to homesteads on fragile balls of rock, nor by an arms race which throws precious resources into the fires of interfactional squabbling. We have to reach beyond the known, develop theories that shatter all that has come before, and apply radical new technologies to ensure our survival. We must reach further and higher than the Domain ever dared!" As she speaks, she raises her eyes up toward some abstraction. 
This, you think, is something she believes in.

"You have proven yourself to be... capable," she says.
"These people," she waves a hand to indicate the Galatia Academy, "are very good at very specific things over which they have obsessed all their lives. But they've kept themselves too long in the ivory tower. They're soft. The world is out there," her voice rises, "And we must change it."
She lowers her voice again, speaking directly to you, "And that is why I need you."

[Line 4132] [Option Selected: "And why should I help you?"]
"I imagine your self-interest would provide sufficient motivation. As you well know, we pay in cash. The prospect of the continuity of technological civilization is an added benefit, is it not?"
"Unless," she pauses, then looks at you over her AR-spex, speaking evenly "I've gravely misjudged you, and your heart is set on liquidating your fleet, donating the proceeds to charity, and taking up with a flagellant order on Hesperus... no, I've got it- you've been doing a lot of reading; well, watching dark-channel holovids mostly- and have half a mind to enlist as a political enforcer smashing teeth in for the 1000-cycle reign of the 'Lion of Sindria'. Did I get it right?"
Your shields hold firm under the broadside of sarcasm deployed by the Provost.

[Line 4133] [Option Selected: "I guess we'll just have to see."]
"Indeed." She leans back, interpreting your response as a stand-down.

[Line 4134] [Option Selected: Let her continue her speech]
"Your tasks will not be so simple from here on out. I expect you to self-adapt to circumstances in pursuit of the objectives I lay out. And." 
She pauses for a moment, considering, before continuing in a tone colder than before, "No matter what you have to do, as long as you pursue the mission goal, I will see that you are rewarded. Securing the future is worth... everything."

[Line 4135] [Option Selected: "I'm not willing to sacrifice all sense of morality for your 'future'."]
"Of course not."
She puts on a smile that isn't entirely friendly.
"And I would never ask it of you. This is exactly why I want to give you so much leeway- so you can do this your way. The right way. You've shown that it works; I cannot deny the evidence in front of my eyes."

She smiles, and you almost believe it.
"That's why I asked you to help: the ability to set your feelings aside and view the situation objectively. You know what it takes to lead and to prevail. I've seen it."

"Ah, the skeptic; of course. As an intellectual, I respect that you don't simply accept my demands due to my authority. I wouldn't have called you here if I wanted an obsequious minion to leap at my every request. I already have those." 
"To your question: you would miss out on the opportunity of your life."
She speaks almost casually, like it doesn't matter what you think. But there's an edge to her voice that suggests she does care, very much. "Whatever your feelings, first hear what I have to say and then consider - rationally - what is best. I am confident that you will discover that our interests align."
"So. Hear me out."

"My predecessor, Provost Tomas Kallichore, led a series of misguided hyperspace manipulation experiments. Ah, how to put it in layman's terms?"
Baird looks troubled to have to do this, sighs, then speaks: "Captain. Your ships fly through hyperspace with special engines. The Gate network of the Domain was similar, but also very different. Kallichore thought there might be a way to use starship hyperdrives to re-open the Gates."
"Obviously it went terribly wrong, and the Galatia system was cut off from hyperspace when the jump-points were disrupted beyond usability. Though we hear some yahoo found a way to cross unstable jump-points; an act well beyond irresponsible considering the chance of a cascading resonance event- ah, I apologize. That is irrelevant."

[Line 4140] [Option Selected: Continue]
"What matters is that once the mess was finally cleared up, the Hegemony descended on the Galatia Academy with a technological inspection fleet. They tore the place apart, arrested the heads of the hyperphysics department and several labs, and of course took Provost Kallichore in for questioning." 
She turns away. "And, with little delay, sentencing." 
"He was a fool, and too trusting," Baird says with contempt. "We lost good people and good research. Scientific breakthroughs are built on the development of theory and, yes, even negative results."

[Line 4140] [Options Given: bairdIntroC6:Continue]

[Line 4141] [Option Selected: Continue]
"I need you to recover Kallichore's secret archive. We need his data from that experiment, and all the others that led up to it. The Hegemony will have kept it. They keep everything. Evidence, you see."
"We shall also need Academician Scylla Coureuse. She was a hyperspace physics researcher, the keystone of the theory team behind the jump-point experiments. The Hegemony, small-minded as they are, only arrested team leaders in the first sweep. They didn't understand that the underlying theory being tested was largely written by one particular academician who was... not suitable for leadership."
"I need you to find her."

[Line 4142] [Option Selected: "How can I get the Kallichore Archive from the Hegemony?"]
"Following the aftermath of the Galatia Experiment, the Hegemony technological inspectors seized everything, all of our records and data."
"The most direct approach would involve accessing the data vaults of the Ministry of Technology Standards. They're who you might call the 'AI Inspectors', and they serve that role, among others, for the Hegemony. It would not be trivial." An amused look crosses her face. "But their security has been breached before..."
"I have an old... acquaintance who has been climbing the Tri-Tachyon executive ladder. His name is Rayan Arroyo, and he is based out of Eochu Bres. He may be compelled to assist us with a human asset on this front. I'll forward you the contact information." She taps for a moment on her desk-interface.

[Line 4144] [Option Selected: "You want me to blackmail a Tri-Tachyon executive?"]
"Not at all. I," she says this with emphasis. "I was simply attentive when a certain Tri-Tachyon executive compromised corporate security to advance his career over a rival."
"He understands the value of the deal he made and he has come out ahead compared to the alternative. You will find him quite cooperative."

[Line 4145] [Option Selected: "Rayan Arroyo. Got it."]
"He compromised corporate security to advance his career over a rival. He understands the value of the deal he made with me."
She almost smiles.
"You will find him quite cooperative once you get past his inflated sense of self-importance."

[Line 4146] [Option Selected: "Do you have any leads on this Scylla Coureuse?"]
"As for the prodigy of Galatia..." Baird trails off.
Is that regret? The look quickly disappears.

[Line 4147] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Coureuse was always an odd fit. Brilliant, yes, but she had a way of being distracted with involvement in, hmm, antagonistic subcultures." Baird waves a hand, dismissing the matter as sociological fluff. "Perhaps the Hegemony crackdown cured her of that childish affectation."
"Her family and, presumably, friends," you wonder for a moment if Baird has any of those, "-are from Fikenhild, in the Westernesse system. You could start there." 

[Line 4147] [Options Given: bairdIntro_scylla2:Continue]

[Line 4148] [Option Selected: Continue]
Baird thinks for a moment. "If you are observed looking for Coureuse, you may be contacted by others who are looking for her. That could be useful. You could cut a deal, get some leads."
"Alternatively, her department was operating experimental packages in the $gaFC_starName system. We have detected some ongoing telemetry that suggests these instruments are still in use, though it isn't clear by whom." She taps her desk interface, "I've sent you the coordinates."
The provost looks at you over her spectacles. "How do you want to handle this, captain? Are you a diplomat or an explorer? Do you want to find the probes in the $gaFC_starName system or talk your way through this on Fikenhild?"

"You need not be so conspiratorial, captain," Baird admonishes, "Not everything is cloak and dagger, blackmail and bribes."
"Our wayward academician has avoided all contact with the Galatia Academy since the Hegemony arrested her colleagues. I appreciate the rational response to a campaign of scientific suppression, but now she is needed for the role she was always meant to play."

[Line 4154] [Option Selected: "I'm sure it will."]
"Indeed," says Baird, looking at you closely. "Her trepidation is a rational response to previous events; the investigations, arrests, the show-trial of Kallichore. But conditions have changed, and she is needed if we are to escape from stagnant local maxima."
Baird turns to the window. "I will call, Scylla will answer," she says. A proclamation?

She turns to her desk display and starts inputting a command sequence, done with you for now.
"Good day, captain," she says without looking up, "You may check in with me via comms for additional analysis as the operation develops, though I expect you to use your initiative."
"Oh, and I've re-authorized Academician Sebestyen with mission assignment access for your file. Carrying out his little jobs might be a good cover for your real work, and allows us to funnel additional credits to you."
You feel the subtle movement of air as the doors open silently behind you. Mirror-masked guards flank a junior agent who waits to escort you back to your shuttle.

Arroyo conversation
------------------------------
[Line 4164] Your comms officer connects your personal terminal to the local network. You activate the audio suppression field around your command station and enter the comms ID provided to you by Provost Baird. The animated logo of some Tri-Tachyon sub-department makes a half rotation before the call is answered.
"Arroyo here. Who's talking to me?" Rayan Arroyo looks you over as if examining a starship hull for scratches. He seems to find something he doesn't quite approve of in you. 
"Who gave you my comms ID?" he demands.

[Line 4165] Your call connects to an automated receiver. The animated logo of a Tri-Tachyon subsidiary spins endlessly on your display. After half a minute and the second time a voice tells you that your patience is appreciated, you conclude that your call is being ignored.
Arroyo wants to discuss business in-person.

[Line 4165] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Close comms]

[Line 4166] [Option Selected: "I'm told you can help me solve a problem."]
"Solve a problem." He says this as if it's a matter far beneath the worth of his attention.
"I don't solve problems, buddy. I pay people to solve problems for me. You got problems? Go talk to the shipyard and get your oxygen leak fixed. I don't care about your problem unless your problem is seven or eight figs of cash in an account that you need put to work."
He's starting to shout. You get the impression that he enjoys this sort of upbraiding. 
"Done wasting my time? Now tell me who gave you my number because I'm going to fire them right after I cut this link."

[Line 4166] [Options Given: gaKA_arroyoProvost:"Provost Anahita Baird."]

[Line 4167] [Option Selected: "Provost Anahita Baird."]
For just a moment, you think you see a wave of panic cross Arroyo's face. It's replaced by a cocky grin, "Oh, of course, of course- the Galatia Academy endowment fund. How could I forget?"
"Here," he taps at something and your comms displays an incoming set of coordinates with the code of a landing beacon. 
"Take a shuttle down. We can touch base about the fund. I'm sure the Provost has exciting plans and I want to hear all about them-" He lifts his eyes upward for a moment and lowers them again to look directly at you. "In person."

He carries on as if this was all perfectly expected. "Ever been planetside? Doesn't count if it's just the arcologies. I'll give you a tour of my chalet. Spectacular views, you'll love it. See you soon."

Your shuttle descends into the young atmosphere of Eochu Bres, through towering battlements of clouds. A spray of rain is cast over your viewport, and it is wiped clean in a blink by the heat and speed of your descent.
The flight path soon deviates from the general approach corridor which has been ticking off minor use-fees from the Tri-Tachyon owned flight control: general volume access fee, priority flight lane fee, service fee, customer satisfaction insurance charge, advertisement bypass fee - you swipe the notifications off and focus on the landscape.

Leaving behind the Tri-Tach arcologies, diamonds growing atop the detritus of tiered slums. Over pipelines, a steel-blue bay, jagged fjords interrupted by ice-jams and landslides. Up and over a great crumbling escarpment like a black wave that fills the horizon; you cross a landscape of oddly-hued tundra spotted with thousands of milky-green lakes.
A new range of mountains rises on the horizon, torn in half by catastrophic workings of the terraformers, and beyond is a chaos of steep valleys populated by dwarf pine and thin white waterfalls. The nav system sounds a tone indicating imminent arrival, and you see Arroyo's private chalet: a small compound of radical geometric architecture surrounded by low outbuildings.
Your shuttle approaches an ellipsoid landing pad that appears to hang in the thin air over a gorge.

A human and a robotic servant greet you placidly as you arrive and lead you inside to a grand parlor done in dark geometric style. Gold inlay gleams in onyx tabletops, and the polished granite floor is set with tastefully patterned jewel-tone carpets placed slightly askew.

Rayan Arroyo is sitting at one of the bars. He acknowledges your entrance with a nod as the servants disappear. He taps his datapad with two fingers. You hear the soft signal loss ping from your datapad and your sidearm-hand twitches instinctively.
Arroyo acknowledges this with the rise of one perfectly groomed eyebrow. "Calm down. Just making sure no one's listening." He flips through a series of null readouts on a datapad and, satisfied, sets it aside.
"So Baird is calling in another installment. What will that be, Captain $playerName?"

He slams down an empty glass. "I know someone who can do it. They're a pain in the ass but, this is key, they're crazy enough to do a job as stupid as the one you're proposing. A hacker called Gargoyle - the real one, not one of the wannabes. We've done business before. Here's the comms ID." Rayan pulls a datakey from a pocket, waves it over his datapad, and after a couple taps pushes it toward you.
"If you get any pushback, if Gargoyle throws a little tantrum, just give it back. It's all about the drama, but in the end you're already in with a job as stupid as this." He holds a hand up, "And by the way, you really did not need to go and tell me your true objective. The last thing I want is Hegemony counterint crawling all over my operation.

He gives you a look. "No. Who cares. Doesn't matter. Most of anything you'll hear about Gargoyle is made up, and half of that is true. So don't bother trying."
He leans back, looking elsewhere, content to talk to himself some more. "What's important is that Gargoyle always gets the job done. My theory is it's some kind of obsessive brain thing," he twirls a hand at his head to demonstrate. "Probably implanted a cybermod the wrong way around and got an AI instead of a frontal lobe."
"Have fun with that one," he says with a smirk.

[Line 4187] [Option Selected: "What's Baird got on you anyway?"]
"What Baird's got is a good investment, and the longer she waits-" he waves at the luxurious surroundings; the career of Rayan Arroyo "-the more interest she'll collect."
A shrug. "It's done well enough for me. We all make deals to get ahead, and I've seen worse. Done worse to others. Plus, I'm an asset now. You can't simply snuff an asset owned by a bigger player." 
He turns and stares directly at you, "And you're an asset now, too. Hypothetical question- what's she got on you?" He gives a cold smile. "I hope you know."

[Line 4188] [Option Selected: Leave]
You've got what you needed from Rayan Arroyo, and with no signal on his part that you can discern, his human and robot servants appear once more.
"I won't say it's been a pleasure, but if you ever have more credits than you know what to do with or, hmm, a truly exceptional business opportunity, let's trade cryptokeys now so you don't have to track space-dust on my carpet again." 
He taps his datapad and offers it, and you perform the mundane ritual which will ensure that anyone who wants to crack your mutual comms will, at least, have to put some effort into the task.

Your shuttle reverses the previous route, down from the highlands, across the plateau of lakes. You spot factory-crawlers disgorging pipe and monorail pylons across the landscape, leaving long tracked trails of torn red dirt.
Across the rocky chaos, and the small cold sea, and over the mountainous slums crowned by glittering spires. Navigation pings and comms noise grows to a small roar over the heart of Tri-Tachyon, and your shuttle returns you to orbit.

Gargoyle, initial conversation
------------------------------
[Line 4192] After connecting to the local network, you enter the comms ID for Gargoyle then pause at the prompt to initiate the call. You look over to your comms officer and they nod, ready to act.
As soon as you execute the command, the electronic warfare console lights up like fleet action in a nebula. Comms wrangles the infosec systems with cool efficiency, coordinating active response with nav, sensors, and engineering stations. 
After perhaps half a minute the storm breaks, the alarms quiet, and your primary display resolves from a mesmerizing fractal battleground to a heavily augmented face grinning impishly.

[Line 4193] [Option Selected: Continue]
"You were ready for me!" Gargoyle says too sweetly to be true before turning to an imagined audience, "The rocket jockey put together enough brains to deal with my little 'hello'!" Gargoyle bounces back and applauds, "Well done!"
"So you know who I am. Tell me, why did Rayan give you my comms ID? More presents, bribes, begging? Did he finally get in trouble with that junta of puppeteering vampires he desperately wishes were his friends? ...On the run from the law and needs a rep wipe?"
A thoughtful pause. "Do you always make that face when you meet new people?"

[Line 4193] [Options Given: gaKA_gargoyleCont2:"I have a job for you. I was told you're the best."]

[Line 4194] [Option Selected: "I have a job for you. I was told you're the best."]
"A job? Uh, no," Gargoyle gags theatrically. "If I ever do a day of 'work' I want you to throw me out the airlock, then throw that airlock into a black hole."
The hacker lounges back carelessly, "But... still listening. Because you told me I'm the best, and I am. That was nice. But I'm not sure you really understand what it is I do." 
A hand studded with interface nodules waves and your display fills with news clips - industrial shutdowns, suspected sabotage, databases hacked, political comms leaked, credits missing, ghost fleets.

[Line 4194] [Options Given: gaKA_gargoyleCont3:Continue]

[Line 4195] [Option Selected: Continue]
"What I do," Gargoyle sits up, looking serious at last. "Is magic." 
"An institution, a polity, a warship, a fleet, the Hegemony! The Luddic Church! The Tri-Tachyon Mega-credits-sucking Corporation! These are machines made of people, and these people don't understand their own machines. Or," a mock-pondering tone, "other people, come to think of it. The oneness of these holy constructs is mass delusion!"
"But I," Gargoyle taps a head-mounted dataport, "I understand. Simply," a finger pokes at you from the display, "Press there. There, then there, and the bubble pops. Push on the right place at the wrong time and the mighty become a sad joke. A gust of wind, a fart of fancy, a flimsy shell that's cracked. Understand?"

[Line 4195] [Options Given: gaKA_gargoyleYes:"Yes, I believe so."
gaKA_gargoyleNotReally:"Not really."
gaKA_gargoyleCanYou:"Can you hack into the datavault of a Hegemony Ministry?"]

[Line 4196] [Option Selected: "Yes, I believe so."]
Gargoyle stares at you, slack-jawed. "Nuh you don't. You're just pretending because you think you need to look tough and smart in front of your minions. It's so obvious."
Gargoyle turns away, "Why do I even bother. Stick to driving your rocketship, Captain $playerFirstName. Pew pow blam! Take that, space pirates! Simple. Direct. Unsophisticated. Artless."
A dramatic sigh, "What a waste of time. Why are we even talking. Why do anything."

[Line 4196] [Options Given: gaKA_gargoyleCanYou:"Can you hack into the datavault of a Hegemony Ministry?"]

[Line 4197] [Option Selected: "Not really."]
Gargoyle stares forlornly, resting chin on hands. "I am wasted on you, $playerFirstName. I'm trying, I really am. Give me something to work with. Please? Otherwise I may just freeze myself for a thousand cycles. Maybe something interesting will have happened by then."

[Line 4197] [Options Given: gaKA_gargoyleCanYou:"Can you hack into the datavault of a Hegemony Ministry?"]

[Line 4198] [Option Selected: "Can you hack into the datavault of a Hegemony Ministry?"]
"I love it!" Gargoyle shouts, sitting up. "A glorious scheme, practically neon-black! Which one? All of them at once? Hmm," visor and cybermods start flickering with activity.

[Line 4198] [Options Given: gaKA_gargoyleExplain:"Hold on- just one, actually." (explain the mission)]

[Line 4199] [Option Selected: "Hold on- just one, actually." (explain the mission)]
You explain to Gargoyle the scope of the mission, and the target - the Kallichore Archive, the personal data store of former Provost Tomas Kallichore which the Hegemony Ministry of Technology Standards seized from the Galatia Academy in the wake of some kind of botched hyperspace experiment. 
You also explain, in terms which avoid any implication of an employer-employee hierarchy, that Rayan Arroyo will be providing funding for the operation.

[Line 4200] [Option Selected: Continue]
As you talk, the comms display with Gargoyle becomes crowded with virtualized half-written lists, reference panels, and code snippets. The hacker leaps from idea to idea, rejecting and accepting contingencies several steps ahead - or adjacent, perhaps - from whatever you are actually saying. The visual chaos is somewhat distracting.

[Line 4200] [Options Given: gaKA_gargoyleCont5:"Do you need some time?"
gaKA_gargoyleCont5a:"Can it even be done?"]

[Line 4202] [Option Selected: "Do you need some time?";['gaKA_gargoyleCont5a']]
"It might be tough. I'm going to need to pass some credits along to a couple friends for some special tricks. Hmm. Do we go all out? Rayan is buying snacks... I think we do. Yes."
"Here's how it's gonna happen- I've got a friend who will make you a little package. It should be ready by the time you get to Nova Maxios. In the Magec system, know it? You pick that up, then do fancy flying and whatever else it takes to install it in the Hegemony comms relay in the Aztlan system."

[Line 4202] [Options Given: gaKA_gargoyleCont5b:Continue]

[Line 4203] [Option Selected: Continue]
A thoughtful pause, then, "For the relay? Go in quiet to do the relay. Park your fleet. Maybe run a lone phase ship for the job, if your ego is capable of surviving away from your big boy toys for a few shifts. Or - this is fun - hack the sensor array and give the Heggies some ghosts to chase."
"Anyway, the installation itself is easy," the hacker continues nonchalantly. "Any work-drone you've got on staff should be able to figure out which end goes where."

[Line 4204] [Option Selected: Continue]
"The real trick comes after: gotta break the Hegemony crypto. That'll be yours truly who's got a little trick I've been saving from a couple cycles ago for just the right moment." Gargoyle holds cable-trailing arms up in a premature display of triumph. "It will be glorious!" Then sits back down.
"Right, so. After you install the hack device on the comm relay, come back here and you can thank me personally when I hand you a copy of the decrypted data. And friend-Rayan has my list of demands," a button tap, "Now."

[Line 4204] [Options Given: gaKA_gargoyleCont7:Continue]

[Line 4205] [Option Selected: Continue]
Another button tap, and there's a ping on your datapad as Gargoyle sends you the address of a small holding facility near the main port-ring of Nova Maxios, as well as the number of a particular storage unit. "It'll be there," Gargoyle says with a smile that seems to imply you're not in on a joke.
"Now I have a lot to do before this is ready, so go along! COMSEC is going to completely blow its top when we pull this off, ha-ha!"
Gargoyle turns to another display, attention focused, cyber augments flickering at an increasing rate as the comm line disconnects on you almost as an afterthought.

[Line 4209] [Option Selected: Take a shuttle to visit Gargoyle's storage unit]
You take a shuttle to the main spaceport concourse, leading a landing party of bodyguards and techs.
The reception lounge ceilings are low, the old tube lights flickering. But the New Maxioans are proud of their makeshift polity; some locals catch your crew eyeing a dripping life support conduit and smile, nudging one another.

[Line 4209] [Options Given: gaKA_visitStorage0:Continue]

[Line 4210] [Option Selected: Continue]
The address given to you by Gargoyle leads you to a run-down logistics ring that looks to be used mostly by failing tramp freighters and smugglers. You ask a young desk clerk where to find the unit number Gargoyle provided.
"Um, oh yes, you must be Captain... R. Boring?" the clerk squints at the desk terminal nervously - you log away this little joke from Gargoyle as you maintain impeccable composure - "I was told you'd be arriving for your cargo just a few minutes ago. Please, come right this way."

[Line 4210] [Options Given: gaKA_visitStorage1:Continue]

[Line 4211] [Option Selected: Continue]
The clerk starts to lead you through a back door, a light bulkhead lock, then freezes: a pallid man in a featureless gray uniform stands on the other side, a spot of gray on the darkness beyond.
"Mister Loke, sir," the clerk stutters, "I wasn't expecting, um, if I'd been told-" 
The man - Mister Loke you presume - smiles blandly and says "I will show the captain the way."
Loke simply stops paying attention to the clerk, shifting his attention to you, still smiling. He nods encouragingly and turns to walk into the darkness beyond the portal.

[Line 4211] [Options Given: gaKA_visitStorage2:Follow]

[Line 4212] [Option Selected: Follow]
Mister Loke leads you past rows of sealed storage units, into a loading bay. Your footsteps produce a dull metallic echo. Something that smells of organic compounds is leaking.
Still smiling blandly, Loke stops and with the wave of his hand unlocks a storage unit. He speaks softly to you, "When she heard of this, Jorien told me she thought it was very funny. She wanted me to come and make sure you got what the Gargoyle asked Elissa to make for you.
His watery eyes stare at the storage unit, "It must be a nice thing."

[Line 4212] [Options Given: gaKA_visitStorage3:"Who are all these people?"
gaKA_visitStorage3a:"Thanks, I think."]

[Line 4214] [Option Selected: "Who are all these people?";['gaKA_visitStorage3a']]
Instead of answering, he gives you a respectful nod, and says "Goodbye," then walks away into the shadows of the warehouse.
You shake your head and turn your attention to the storage unit. Inside you find a single standard shipping crate. You motion the techs forward, and they approach with various handheld scanners; you are in no hurry to be the butt of another of Gargoyle's 'jokes'.

[Line 4214] [Options Given: gaKA_visitStorage4:Continue]

[Line 4215] [Option Selected: Continue]
The lead tech starts reporting. "Power source. Anomalous neutrinos. And um, minor hyperwave phase distortion?" 
The entire crew of technicians take an unconscious step back. Hyperwave phasing technology has a poor reputation. And it's never been known to fit in so small a package and remain stable.
An hour later, as you are finishing your second hot drink at a nearby cafe, the techs give the all-clear through your datapad, concluding that as strange as this device is - seemingly a hand-built one-off hyperwave transmitter of some kind - it should pose no immediate danger.
You order it removed to your flagship.

[Line 4215] [Options Given: gaKA_visitStorage5:Continue]

[Line 4216] [Option Selected: Continue]
On the shuttle ride back to your $shipOrFleet you ponder tactics for inserting this device into the Aztlan Hyperwave Relay without being spotted by a Hegemony patrol. A small, fast detachment could do it. Or phase ships, using their fields to lower sensor profile. Or with a little luck you could find a quiet moment between patrol rotations...
The intercom crackles, "Captain, we've arrived."

You give the go-order to your ops chief, who starts speaking in a low voice to the hand-picked squad of veteran salvage techs that are already crossing to the relay on a cargo drone.
The entire operation is carried out swiftly and according to the drills. A few quick cuts with low-EM tools, bulkhead section removed, Gargoyle's device secured in place. Parasite microdrones in the chassis will finish attaching key connections; taps into fiber lines, mostly. The bulkhead is sealed and the team withdraws with a few puffs of cold gas thrusters as silently as they approached.

[Line 4221] [Options Given: daKA_installHack1:Continue]

[Line 4222] [Option Selected: Continue]
Shortly, your comms officer confirms a short burst indicating that Gargoyle's device is operational.
Despite Gargoyle's cavalier attitude toward the entire enterprise, your comms and tech officers speculate that a hack this intrusive will be discovered very quickly indeed. It would be best to make a hasty escape while you remain undetected.

[Line 4222] [Options Given: daKA_installHack2:Continue]

[Line 4223] [Option Selected: Continue]
You wonder, too, if the Hegemony will trace the hack back to Gargoyle's hideout. A Tri-Tachyon controlled polity is unlikely to cooperate quickly with any Hegemony investigation.
But then the investigation might not be 'official', and less an investigation than a black ops snatch squad. 
You should retrieve the archive from Gargoyle quickly.

"Captain, you need to take me on your ship and get me out of here. They know where I am. I've really done it this time, it's incredible." Gargoyle lets out a nervous laugh, "The greatest data heist since the Second AI War!" 
The hacker seems to realize the gravity of this statement, "I think- they are pretty, very, extremely, entirely unhappy this time. It's not safe. Take me to ... to the Galatia Academy? Anahita can hide me, right? After all I've done, she has to."

"Just- I- Everyone!"
"Let me count my new friends," Gargoyle starts ticking off fingers, "The Hegemony for starters, whoever COMSEC thinks to send. I expect an official expedition will cause a diplomatic incident, so probably shadowy gun-fun goons will sneak in to try to murder me. Next, Tri-Tachyon, at least once they're tipped off by the Hegemony's blundering response. And the Pathers, can't forget them. The Hegemony leaks like a hull breach to all the little Ludders and they're going to simply love everything about this."
"Let me summarize for you, my good captain: within, oh, two or three shifts, this place will be in the crossfire of an interfactional criticality event and every second spacer buying noodles on the concourse is going to be an assassin or spy."

[Line 4232] [Option Selected: "Do you have the Kallichore Archive?"]
"There's no time for that! But-" Gargoyle smirks. "-I see what you're trying. Don't worry, I've got it locked up nice and secure, encrypted with my own special juice, and backed up off-site. It'd take an Alpha Core to break it out, and that'd take time. If you knew where to look. And you don't." 
"Professor Anahita won't have that kind of time if I spill everything you've done together to the big bad Hegemony. So where's my shuttle?"

[Line 4233] [Option Selected: "What if I just leave you here?"]
Gargoyle's voice goes cold. "Then you don't get your precious data archive, Captain $playerName. Because I've got it locked up nice and secure, and backups off-site. By the way, you wouldn't believe what I have on Rayan Arroyo, on your boss Anahita Baird, on all sorts of people! Even you, my dear captain. The High Hegemon will have a fit when he watches you asking me to hack their precious ministry of technology suppression on Sector-wide news channels."
The hacker smiles without warmth, "It's me or nothing, cap."

[Line 4234] [Option Selected: Order a shuttle to pick up Gargoyle]
Gargoyle nods, "That's the way, captain. I'll collect my toys."
Your shuttle gets in and out without any suspicious inquiries from traffic control; they're not wise to what's going on yet. Probably. 
You order Gargoyle confined to quarters well away from the bridge, and for your comms officer to keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
"Captain," your tactical officer calls for your attention, "Hegemony fleet incoming."
Time to go.

Conversation with patrol that intercepts you after you leave Magec
------------------------------
[Line 4238] The comms crackle to life to display a Hegemony $rank staring you down. "Independent fleet captain! You are ordered to power down shields, weapon systems, and drives. You are suspected of harboring a known criminal and partaking in criminal conspiracy to breach Hegemony data security." 
$HisOrHer lip curls arrogantly, "You will be boarded by Hegemony marines and your databanks seized for inspection. Your cargo will be seized for inspection. You will authorize unlimited access to all components of your $shipOrFleet. You will give no resistance. Hesitation will be considered resistance. Insubordination will be considered resistance. Surrender your command codes immediately."

[Line 4239] [Option Selected: Continue]
You blink at these outrageous orders, tantamount to interstellar piracy. Even the law of the Hegemony, by the old Domain Naval Code, grants you certain rights. You'd guess that this is an overzealous $rank going a bit rogue in interpreting $hisOrHer orders.
As you think this over, you watch the Hegemony $rank's face turning a deeper shade of red, perhaps interpreting your pause as 'resistance'. It may be hard to get out of this one without a fight.

$HisOrHer eyes narrow, "Surrender now and I might consider leniency. Unless even a hint of insubordination escapes from your traitor's mouth."

The Hegemony $ranks eyes start to widen just as you hit the disconnect. The image goes black and $hisOrHer shout is lost in dying static.
"$PlayerSirOrMadam," your tactical officer reports, "They're moving to attack."
You reflect for a moment that this gross violation of Sector commerce law suggests that the Hegemony is more likely to cover up any 'incident' that occurs in the next moments rather than undermine its own lawful legitimacy.

You pull off a snappy salute.
"$SirOrMadam. I must report a misunderstanding. I am in command of a special auxiliary detachment in pursuit of a suspected infiltrator and saboteur. As per the standing HERMES BLACK order regarding compromised and-or fraudulent comms I am operating without a Hegemony transponder or active hypercomms interlink. The mission parameters provided by my CO allow for independent initiative."

$HeOrShe looks skeptical as you confidently rattle off legitimate-sounding Hegemony jargon. The Hegemony $rank looks down at you and asks, "Under what authority do you operate, captain? Who's your CO?"
No hesitation now.

[Line 4247] [Option Selected: "Admiral Orcus Rao, Ragnar fleet command."]
The Hegemony $rank's face doesn't change. Time for the cherry on top.
"He activated my fleet as a military auxiliary under the Chicomoztoc protocols," you explain. "I had to leave a whole cargo of transplutonics on the docks at Raesvelg."
"$SirOrMadam," you add again.

[Line 4247] [Options Given: gaKA_patrolLie4:Continue]

[Line 4248] [Option Selected: Continue]
This seems to do it. The $rank's posture softens almost imperceptibly.
"Admiral Rao always did push the line, didn't he. This is highly irregular, captain, and I will be reporting it. But." $HisOrHer chin raises an inch, "The professionals are going to be taking over this chase. Transmit the last contact and course you observed from the target."
You try to look suitably disappointed as you quietly order your nav and comms officers to come up with something plausible. They improvise with admirable speed, and you watch as $Rank $personLastName glances at $hisOrHer console, satisfied.

[Line 4248] [Options Given: gaKA_patrolLie5:"Good hunting. $SirOrMadam."]

[Line 4249] [Option Selected: "Good hunting. $SirOrMadam."]
"Indeed," $HeOrShe says. "Report back to Admiral Rao and suggest that he not make such a mess of standard operations by insisting on being too clever by half."
$HeOrShe terminates the comms without a salute. You almost feel offended.
Then you reflect for a moment at your good sense at paying half-attention to some of the Hegemony propaganda-docs playing in port concourse bars on slow nights.

You step off the shuttle, thrusters clicking as they cool, with Gargoyle in tow. The hacker's barrage of questions, suggestions, and handsiness toward any control panel or gadget within reach has you at the limit of your patience after only a brief trip.

"Anahita, we meet at last!" Gargoyle bows grandly.
"I am honored to accept your invitation to teach at the Galatia Academy," then stands up straight and smiles widely, looking around. "What shall my curriculum be, hmm? Excellent parties, security theater, perhaps a personal account of the salacious events leading up to the Third AI War?"
Baird smiles mirthlessly, then motions someone from her party forward.

"Gargoyle, meet Academician Alviss Sebestyen," Baird says in a tone that would not be out of place on the bridge of a Hegemony warship. "Alviss, kindly show Gargoyle to the guest suite we've prepared. Now, please." 
She turns from them to you, apparently confident that Sebestyen will handle the situation.
"Captain. Our guest complicates matters, but..." she turns to watch the two leave the receiving lounge, Gargoyle seemingly choosing to cooperate with Sebestyen's stammering appeals; the hacker seems to be wholly occupied by discovering how to fluster the academician.

"It appears that I have gained another valuable asset in addition to the Kallichore Archive," she says. "By virtue of your initiative, of course, captain. I will not forget that when the time comes, but-" she takes in her surroundings, and dismisses the guards and advisors with a wave.
Baird holds up a hand to indicate an adjoining transport pod, "Let us remove to a more suitable setting to complete our conversation."

[Line 4257] [Options Given: gaKA_return6:Continue]

[Line 4258] [Option Selected: Continue]
Baird seems to study the passing conduits and vistas visible through the pod's bay windows, lost in thought. The silence grows, and you find that this may be an opportunity to ask something of the provost without interrupting one of her lectures.

[Line 4259] [Options Given: gaKA_returnWhatWillHegDo:"What will you do if the Hegemony suspects you're behind the hack?"]

[Line 4260] [Options Given: gaKA_returnThinkOfGargoyle:"So what do you think of Gargoyle?"]

[Line 4261] [Options Given: gaKA_return7:Say nothing]

[Line 4262] [Option Selected: "What will you do if the Hegemony suspects you're behind the hack?"]
Baird looks at you. "They suspect me already, of course."
"The Galatia Academy will appeal the original data seizure and demand the return of basic scientific research material- which is not illegal under even old Domain law. 'This data breach only proves the danger of restricting basic research as this situation enables unsavory parties to exploit discoveries without oversight from the ecumenica'."
"I appreciate the irony of my objection, of course. But this is war by public relations: there is no room for scruples. I'll be exactly as cynical as they already believe me to be, and they'll believe the act because it is true." As Baird speaks, you find a note of satisfaction in her description of plot and counter-plot. "Behind that truth of course," she continues, "Is what really happened. Which shall be a fait accompli once they discover it, and one too embarrassing to publicize." 

[Line 4263] [Option Selected: "So what do you think of Gargoyle?"]
Baird looks at you, raises an eyebrow, then looks back at nothing.
"Singularly charming," she says deadpan. "I taught for twenty cycles, captain. I've had worse."

[Line 4264] [Option Selected: Say nothing]
Through the silence, you can almost hear Baird thinking.
The transport pod hisses to a halt, and you feel the subtle shift of agrav fields. You step off and note that this seems to be a back entrance which allows Baird to avoid the waiting room full of important people unused to being asked to wait.

[Line 4265] [Option Selected: Continue]
You follow Provost Baird into her office, and the doors close with a notable absence of sound. She motions you to a seat in front of her desk as she unlocks the interface.
"Captain, allow me to properly compensate you for your good work." She taps a command and your personal datapad pings in response. "I trust this will help cover certain of your expenses."
Your personal datapad pings; incoming funds transfer.

[Line 4265] [Options Given: gaKA_return8b:Continue]

[Line 4266] [Option Selected: Continue]
Now Baird's interface pings; an incoming signal. "Ah, good," Baird says, and slides a datapad over for your inspection.
It is a detailed progress report on Gargoyle's activities, including time-tables for decrypting the Kallichore Archive.
"Sebestyen is more capable than he appears. He is both persistent and meticulous, as you can see."

[Line 4266] [Options Given: gaKA_return9a:Continue]

[Line 4267] [Option Selected: Continue]
She motions at the datapad, "We should have the Archive decrypted in about a week. The value of this research data is enormous, of course, but we still require the means to put theory to practice. And that means is Coureuse. "
"Hers is not a unique genius, mind you," Baird says, with an almost uncharacteristic lack of certainty. "We could find other candidates to lead the research team, but the study and training... no, my timescale is too short. We need Scylla Coureuse."

[Line 4267] [Options Given: gaKA_return10a:Continue]

[Line 4268] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Find her, captain," Baird says, "And quickly." She turns away, dismissing you. "We shall speak more about what I am building toward another time."
You feel the doors open soundlessly behind you, and you sense the presence of mirror-masked guards like a slight increase in ambient static electricity. Time to go.

[Line 4268] [Options Given: gaKA_returnLeave:Leave]

[Line 4270] As you enter Baird's office, you notice Scylla Coureuse waiting in the sitting area. She nods in greeting as she folds up a portable workstation.
"Ah, Scylla. Good. Give me just a moment." Baird moves behind her desk, unlocks the interface, and taps in a command.
"Captain, allow me to properly compensate you for your good work," Baird says. "I trust this will help cover certain of your expenses."

[Line 4270] [Options Given: gaKA_return8CourB:Continue]

[Line 4271] [Option Selected: Continue]
She turns back to her desk interface and taps a few more keys, activating a holoprojector. A detailed progress report on Gargoyle's activities flickers into being, including time-tables for decrypting the Kallichore Archive.
Baird motions at the display, "Sebestyen is more capable than he appears. He is both persistent and meticulous."
Coureuse speaks up, "He's been very helpful in getting my new team set up."

[Line 4271] [Options Given: gaKA_return9b:Continue]

[Line 4272] [Option Selected: Continue]
Bairds nods in acknowledgement, and Coureuse continues, "It looks like we should have the Archive fully decrypted in about a week. Depending on what we get sooner, I may be able to restart my, ah, previous avenues of research."
Coureuse looks to you, "The Galatia jump-point experiment," she says, giving name to her previous project. "That's not how I wanted to do it. But Provost Tomas, he said the timetable was too-"
Baird interrupts, "You don't need to explain yourself, academician. The captain understands that you will take all reasonable precautions when we reach the experimentation stage. In fact, they will be instrumental in carrying out these experiments."

[Line 4272] [Options Given: gaKA_return10b:Continue]

"This is about opening up the galaxy again, captain. Yes, you see it now: the Gates. It was always about the Gates." 
Baird taps a datapad and the holoprojector flickers a 3D hyphae map into existence. You recognize the image- a map of the Domain-era gate network within the Persean Sector. A dense spot in one prominent lobe contains what you know as the Core Worlds.
"Or, more precisely, what the Gates can do," Baird says.

[Line 4278] [Options Given: gaKA_return12b:Continue]

[Line 4279] [Option Selected: Continue]
Coureuse speaks up, now, "It's about freedom! What the Domain used to dominate humanity, well, we can escape from this small, cruel world. We still live in their shadow, I mean- the Hegemony of course. But even Tri-Tachyon and the Luddics, they're all reactions to the power the Domain had. No one has truly escaped." 
Scylla Coureuse looks up at the slowly spinning gate network, "But maybe we can. All of us."

[Line 4279] [Options Given: gaKA_return13b:Continue]

[Line 4280] [Option Selected: Continue]
You notice that Baird has watched Coureuse without emotion through this speech. At its conclusion, the provost speaks to you in a tone of commanding finality, "Come back in a week or so, captain. My people need time to work. And you've earned a break. But keep your head down, the factions are restless after the job you pulled in Aztlan."
Baird turns to her desk console, expressions moving across her face as she appears to skim messages. "That is all, captain. And Scylla."

[Line 4281] [Option Selected: "I want to talk about your intentions with this technology."]
Baird turns from her desk display and looks through you, "There is no 'technology', captain. Merely possibilities. And vast though those possibilities may be, they are yet mere possibilities."
She turns away again, dismissing you. "We shall speak of this later."
Coureuse gives you a sympathetic look as she packs up her portable workstation.
You feel the doors open soundlessly behind you, and the mirror-masked guards presence like a slight increase in static electricity. Time to go.

Arroyo looks even less pleased to see you after this statement.
"I see," he says.
He raises a gold-ringed finger, "Don't tell me a single word. It's Gargoyle. I know very well that I don't want to know what that absurd vandal is planning. I'll pay the bills that show up, that's the deal." He grimaces, "And I'll forward my invoice to Provost Baird so that ivory-tower puppetmaster can appreciate how much she's wringing me for."
"Now get off my comms."
He terminates the connection.

The display resolves from a mesmerizing fractal battleground to a familiar face grinning impishly at you. "Oh $playerFirstName, are you having trouble finding Nova Maxios? Let me help, I'll send you a copy of Baby's First Star Chart." 
Your TriPad chimes softly.
"Go on, read it. Find 'M is for Magec'. You can figure it out! I believe in you." Gargoyle turns away and waves you off as your comms seem to disconnect of its own accord.

The display resolves without incident to a familiar face grinning impishly. "Ah, Captain $playerFirstName! You must have forgotten my simple instructions."
Gargoyle counts off fingers, "Step one, collect the device. You did that, hurray! Step two, install it on the Aztlan Relay in - pay attention now, maybe get your scowly comms officer to take a memo - in the Aztlan system. Step three, come back to me for your precious data archive." 
The hacker waves the remaining two fingers at you in a rude gesture. "And that's how it's done. Bye bye, busy now."
Your comms disconnect seemingly of their own accord.

[Line 4293] [Option Selected: Tell Baird about Gargoyle's plan to hack a Hegemony relay]
Provost Baird listens patiently as you explain. When you are finished, she waits a moment, then says crisply "I do not need to know your every move, captain, provided that you carry out your ultimate objective. If this 'Gargoyle' is the one I've heard so much about, then we have a good chance of acquiring the Kallichore Archive."
"Your course of action is obvious: help the hacker do it by whatever means are necessary, at whatever cost is required." She adopts the tone of a disappointed teacher, "Surely you don't need me to tell you this."

"Your course of action is obvious: help this 'Gargoyle' by whatever means are necessary, at whatever cost is required." Baird turns to her desk display, scanning for her next appointment. A dismissal.

[Line 4302] [Options Given: gaKA_courAskAbtZal:"Have you been in contact with Elissa Zal lately?"]

[Line 4303] [Option Selected: "Do you think Baird can be trusted?"]
She looks at you for a moment then sighs.
"You know she'll probably listen to this, right? Well, she knows how I feel, and I'm not going to pretend I believe otherwise. I don't like a lot about what she does and how she does it."
"Say what you will about the provost, she's... effective. It's better than any alternative I've seen so far."

[Line 4303] [Options Given: gaKA_courBaird2:"The alternative?"]

[Line 4304] [Option Selected: "The alternative?"]
"I don't know," she says, "Making weapons for the Hegemony? Sector collapse to pre-hyperdrive levels? Torturing AI shards for Tri-Tach? I couldn't do that. I don't even know what the Luddics would make of me."
Coureuse gives a laugh, "Put me in a nunnery, probably. Might not be so bad."

[Line 4305] [Option Selected: "Your friend Cavin doesn't seem like the type that would ever work for Baird."]
"Cavin." She just pauses for a moment, looking up and elsewhere. Then she smiles a little, and shakes her head.
"No, he wouldn't. He'd get on with Baird like a hull breach, that's for sure. Um. Why do you ask?"

[Line 4305] [Options Given: gaKA_courAskAbtCavinA:"I was wondering if you shared his... views."
gaKA_courAskAbtCavinB:"He seems... unreliable. You were close, once."
gaKA_courAskAbtCavinC:"I apologize, it is not my business."]

[Line 4306] [Option Selected: "I was wondering if you shared his... views."]
"Ah," she lets out an awkward laugh. "I see. He has a way of making an impression, doesn't he. That's why he was so... um."
She shakes her head once, then looks at you brightly; a facade pulled over whatever her true feelings are. "Well, captain," she says, "I'm not still there in that art collective, am I?"

[Line 4306] [Options Given: gaKA_courAskAbtCavinA2a:"I suppose not."
gaKA_courAskAbtCavinA2:"That's a question, not an answer."]

[Line 4308] [Option Selected: "That's a question, not an answer.";['gaKA_courAskAbtCavinA2a']]
The moment draws out. "Um," she looks away, then rapidly taps on her lab-interface, flooding the view with holographic data-tables. "I really must be getting back to work. Good-bye."
The feed flickers and a generic Galatia Academy holding signal appears.

[Line 4309] [Option Selected: "He seems... unreliable. You were close, once."]
"Unreliable... I mean, yes, he was that," she admits. "He just has different priorities than most people. He doesn't really align with, well, institutions. It's what made him so... well, he was exciting, that's for sure." She looks down for a moment, "But at some point... if you're not his priority, when it's really important, well, that's the end of that."
"Um," she blinks several times, like waking up from a dream. "I really should get back to work." Coureuse rapidly taps on several interfaces, flooding the view with holographic data-tables. "Good-bye captain."
The feed flickers and a generic Galatia Academy holding signal appears.

"No, I..." She blinks rapidly. "Of course not. The, the equipment was all back in the Isirah system..."

The feed flickers and a generic Galatia Academy holding signal appears.

[Line 4312] [Option Selected: "Has Gargoyle been helpful?"]
"Oh, very helpful," she says with a smile, "You get a, just a really different perspective from Gargoyle. There are so many assumptions, invisible little things we do, um, as an institutional organization without realizing, and - well, and also the technical stuff, like code. It's been - hmm, a bit strange. And teamwork in the traditional sense is mostly out of the question. But if we find a little self-contained project for Gargoyle, it can work out great."
"Thank you for all you've done for us. It could have gone very poorly."

Tri-Tachyon fixer encounter

[Line 4316] [Options Given: gaKA_ttContinue:Continue]

[Line 4318] As your gaze begins to skim the crowd for potential jobs, a $manOrWoman in spotless Tri-Tachyon executive attire insinuates themself in front of you.
"Captain $playerName, we are so pleased that you have chosen to visit this franchise. The Tri-Tachyon Corporation values your contribution to the local economy," $heOrShe smiles perfectly as you realize that your hand is being shaken.
"If we may sit over here, I would like to discuss a special matter... Company business."

Somehow the Tri-Tachyon agent's smile grows brighter and more perfect. "We just want to clear up a little confusion, you're not in trouble in the least."
"Please," $heOrShe indicates a spot where a curtain has been withdrawn to reveal a private booth that you did not previously notice was even there, "Let us provide you with a complimentary refreshment."

[Line 4325] [Option Selected: Follow the agent]
You idly tap a pricey drink from the menu and it appears before you within seconds.
Noticing your surprise, the agent explains "Each customer builds a Tri-Taste profile as they enjoy our products. Correlating purchase history with time of day and certain other physiological signifiers allows- " $heOrShe raises $hisOrHer hands apologetically, "I get carried away sometimes. It's my passion for customer satisfaction."
You understand what is being said: We're watching you.
"But we're here to talk about your business," the agent's hand gently points at you without otherwise moving, "Not mine."

[Line 4325] [Options Given: gaKA_ttBusiness:"What business might that be?"
gaKA_ttAppreciate:"I don't appreciate being spied on."]

[Line 4326] [Option Selected: "What business might that be?"]
"There was an incident recently. The Aztlan Relay was compromised. Very embarrassing for HEGCOM, what with a, ah, history of such incidents. With embarrassment comes a propensity for overreaction, of conclusion leapt at based on long-held biases against the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Now, we consider the unpleasantness of the AI Wars water under the bridge. After all, there's business to be done." 
The agent's smile disappears, and $hisOrHer tone goes cold, "Our shareholders have much to lose. We cannot allow tensions to be inflamed by... adventurism." $HisOrHer eyes narrow, "Nor do I expect the current provost of Galatia to last long in her post. Give some thought to who you choose to do business with."

[Line 4326] [Options Given: gaKA_ttOffer:"Are you making me an offer?"

For a long few seconds, no response. Then the agent's smile appears again.
"I am pleased to hear that you are receptive to the suggestion," $heOrShe says, then stands. "The Company will be in contact, I'm sure. Thank you for your time, $playerName. I'm certain you will continue to respect the business-friendly environment we cultivate in Tri-Tachyon space and beyond."
The Tri-Tachyon agent disappears into some shadow. You look back at your untouched drink. A bubble breaks onto the surface.

[Line 4327] [Options Given: gaKA_ttLeaveToBarB:Go back to the bar]

[Line 4328] [Option Selected: "I don't appreciate being spied on."]
The agent unleashes $hisOrHer perfect smile once more.
"By entering this establishment you have agreed to certain terms and conditions. By entering Tri-Tachyon space- you understand. Besides," $heOrShe drops the perfect smile. "I think you are well beyond that, considering the company you have been keeping."

[Line 4334] You begin taking stock of the patrons, looking for leads. As you scan the room, suddenly you lock eyes with a $manOrWoman in Hegemony uniform. $HeOrShe raises a hand, and holding it close to $hisOrHer chest points at you while saying something to the uniformed civil control officer at $hisOrHer side.
Turning to find a path for an inconspicuous exit, you see that more c-cons have appeared - by their posture, you surmise that they are holding small hand weapons on your bodyguards, who have responded in kind.

[Line 4334] [Options Given: gaKA_hegContinue1:Continue]

[Line 4335] [Option Selected: Continue]
In the main entrance you see a flick of targeting lasers shift through near-IR from the silhouette of a light combat exoskeleton. Conversation in the room dies as patrons realize what is happening, leaving only the holos churning out noise. Time seems to slow as you take in the situation with instincts honed in space combat.
Patrons clear out of the bar in a remarkably casual manner, heads lowered, as if they had simply forgotten an appointment and can't be bothered to finish their drinks.

[Line 4335] [Options Given: gaKA_hegContinue2:Continue]

"I apologize for this crude posturing, Captain $playerName," the Hegemony officer says as $heOrShe approaches. $HeOrShe has a smooth Eventide academy accent; cream of the crop.
"Protocol," $heOrShe says with feigned resignation. You feel the silent mass of c-con thugs hovering closer behind you. The Hegemony officer gives a little stand-down wave, then says "Let us sit and have an informal chat. Let the Hegemony buy you a drink. That would be nice, yes?"
It seems you have little choice in the matter. Best play along until you get a read on the situation.

[Line 4337] [Option Selected: Continue]
The bartender, sweating, places two drinks on the table between you and scurries off.
"Now I'm sure you've heard of the recent unpleasantness in the Aztlan system, yes? A terrible thing, this data-breach. Are you a student of history, captain? It's the sort of thing that starts wars, so we very much want to ensure that our investigation is ... conclusive."
"We know your $shipOrFleet was in the vicinity- no," $heOrShe smiles pleasantly, "You're not being accused of anything. I simply want to draw upon your patriotism and report if you... saw anything. As any good citizen would."

[Line 4338] [Options Given: gaKA_hegDidntSee:"I'm sure I didn't see anything, officer."]

[Line 4344] [Option Selected: "I'm sure I didn't see anything, officer."]
"Indeed," $heOrShe frowns, eyes fixed on you. "Perhaps if we examined your sensor logs we would find something that slipped your mind." 
But that would require a warrant, which requires very clear evidence of wrongdoing. The Hegemony could override the requirement, or manufacture it, but you know their bureaucracy moves slowly.
"Have you met or heard of an individual by the name of 'Gargoyle'? There is a significant reward for information, you know."

[Line 4345] [Option Selected: "You got me. I hacked the Aztlan Relay."]
The Hegemony officer frowns. "I am not here to make light of a serious security breach, captain. I understand you have a reputation, and that makes you very interesting. You might be wise to make yourself a great deal less interesting, captain, before the Hegemony starts to take you seriously."

[Line 4346] [Option Selected: "What's with the goon squad?"]
The Hegemony officer produces a fake smile, then speaks an order into $hisOrHer cuff. You note the c-com covering the room fall away. "You must excuse my department. Some of my... associates suggested a different approach to our meeting. We compromised."
$HeOrShe gives you an open look, "I argued for an informal chat, captain. Make me right. Help me help you help the Hegemony."

[Line 4347] [Option Selected: "Sounds like Tri-Tachyon beat you again."]
$HeOrShe mutters into $hisOrHer cuff. You catch the phrase "waste of time".
The Hegemony officer stands abruptly, bumping the table and spilling some of the undrunk drinks. "Get out of this bar. If my department finds you anywhere near another 'mysterious incident', I assure you that we will not be so lenient."
$HeOrShe storms out the front door. The bartender's eyes flick back to you, expressionless.

[Line 4347] [Options Given: gaKA_hegLeaveSorry:"Sorry about that."
gaKA_hegJustLeave:Just leave]

[Line 4348] [Option Selected: "Am I under arrest, or can I go?"]
"You are not under arrest, citizen," $heOrShe admits. But the officer's face freezes in slow anger, "I tried to make this easy for you, you know. The security of the Hegemony ensures the security of the entire sector- to trade freely, to live, to survive. These are easy times compared to what the Hegemony has faced in the past. Do not make yourself an enemy here, captain."
The Hegemony officer stands abruptly, bumping the table and spilling some of the undrunk drinks. "If my department finds you anywhere near another 'mysterious incident', I assure you that we will not be so lenient. Consider this an official warning."
$HeOrShe marches out the front door. The bartender's eyes flick back to you, expressionless.

gaFC Fikenhild investigation
------------------------------
[Line 4364] [Options Given: 2:gaFC_visitFikenhild:Shuttle to the surface to pursue the list of Coureuse associates]

[Line 4366] Descending through pillars of stormcloud over sparkling seas, your shuttle glides toward 'Kay-arco', the cosmopolitan megapolis-arcology of Fikenhild. Dampers dull the shock of atmospheric entry to a whisper as you review Baird's list of Coureuse's associates, starting with the first entry.
Adonya Coureuse is noted as a surviving parent, and lives in a pensioners' quarter.
It seems reasonable to start with her.

[Line 4367] You review Baird's list of Coureuse's associates on Fikenhild. 
Bione Lata is tagged as 'childhood friend', and lives in an exurb community. 
Perhaps she knows something more of Scylla Coureuse's personal connections from her early life. At the very least any other agent following similar leads would have had to have contacted Bione.

[Line 4368] You review Baird's list of Coureuse's associates on Fikenhild. 
Cavin Pharoh's file has an attached file about an event at some kind of art co-op operated by undercity radicals.
He seems like the sort that is used to hiding from the authorities. Maybe he, or someone he knows, is helping Coureuse. You scroll through some holos of what passes for artwork in Cavin's association, and judging by the content, you feel that local MuniSec probably has Cavin on a list.

[Line 4369] You review Baird's list of Coureuse's associates. It looks like you've cleared the best hits. And besides, you've got a strong new lead to follow up on.

[Line 4370] You stand for a moment at the transport hub, considering your options.

[Line 4371] [Options Given: 0:gaFC_visitA:Visit Adonya Coureuse in the overcity]

[Line 4372] [Options Given: 1:gaFC_visitB:Visit Bione Lata in the exurbs]

[Line 4376] [Options Given: 11:defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 4377] [Option Selected: Return to your shuttle]
On your way back to the shuttle you review the information given to you by Baird as well as your own notes. Interrogating civilians is not your usual method - perhaps investigating the probes that Scylla, or someone close to her, may still be using in the $gaFC_starName system will reveal more concrete results.
You recall that Provost Baird asked you to inform her if you decided to change your approach to the matter of Scylla Coureuse.

[Line 4378] [Option Selected: Return to your shuttle]
You return to your shuttle, considering what you've learned. The answer you seek feels very close now.
You stop yourself from tapping at your datapad impatiently; the comm directory will always be there.

"I don't have any associates by that name." $HeOrShe sounds irritated.
"I'm answering your call because facilitating interstellar trade with independent operators is within my purview. If you're simply looking for a comms ID, I suggest you query a public search terminal."
"Now. Do you have any real business to discuss?"

[Line 4386] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for someone by the name of Scylla Coureuse."]
"Right. I don't know who that is." $HeOrShe sounds annoyed. "I'm not a comm directory."
"I am here to coordinate Persean League civil and military assets to ensure the safety and security of Fikenhild and the local system. If you have business to discuss relating to these matters, I would be delighted to assist you." 
$HeOrShe doesn't sound particularly delighted, but your diplomatic intuition suggests it would be best not to point this out.

$HeOrShe blinks, taken aback. "$PlayerSirOrMadam." 
You hear the tap of keys and a quick glance aside.
"My apologies. I was... your admittance to the League is quite recent. My congratulations."
$HisOrHer voice doesn't quite have the warmth of enthusiasm $hisOrHer words would require to stand on their own.

"A joker, huh." $HeOrShe narrows $hisOrHer eyes. "You know that interfering with my duties is a civil offense? Lucky for you, you're not worth the bother of prosecution."

The comms cut rather abruptly.

$HeOrShe blinks. "Captain."
You hear the tap of keys and a quick glance aside.
"Yes, I confirm that." $HeOrShe produces a brief, unenthusiastic smile.
"However I am forbidden to provide you with information on a League citizen on a League world without proper authorization, due cause, or an order from the King or the Prime Demarchon." $HeOrShe spreads $hisOrHer hands. "I want to help you, but procedure must be followed."

[Line 4411] [Option Selected: "... Have you seen the name Coureuse? Or heard of her?"]
"Much better." $HeOrShe puts down a TriPad and gives you $hisOrHer full attention. "If you want to ask a question, ask the question. Don't make me feel like I'm doing you a favor, stars above."
A pause.
"No. And No."

ask around the bar on Fikenhild
------------------------------
[Line 4417] You ask around about the missing academician, buying moderately priced drinks to lubricate the flow of information. This is a spacer bar, and though spacers try to look out for one another you're finding little in the way of leads, mostly just shrugs and apologies.
One graying space dog accepts your drink and says, "Academician eh? If you're digging into the trouble that went down in Galatia not-too-long ago, I suggest you make well clear. Heggie boots came down hard and fast. Noodling with the jump-points is one thing, but what I hear is there was some business with one of them AIs behind it. Masterminding, like."

gaFCfikenhild_barEvent2:"A secret AI masterminding an invasion of the core worlds?"]

[Line 4418] [Option Selected: "A secret AI masterminding an invasion of the core worlds?"]
The spacer winks, takes a deep drink, and speaks more quietly. "Aye, you see if they can close down the jump-points, all they gotta do is open the Gates right up and pow!"
A fist slams down on the table, rattling a couple empties.
"The invasion fleet! The one they've been settin' fer last two hun'erd cycles. See, it all adds up - them Ludd figure disappears, the exact moment them Gates go shut-down? You see what it means?"

[Line 4418] [Options Given: backToBar:Make your excuses and return to the bar
gaFCfikenhild_barEvent3:"Ludd and the AIs were working together?"]

[Line 4419] [Option Selected: "Ludd and the AIs were working together?"]
The spacer takes another deep drink, continuing, "In-deed. Timings too perfect, ya'see? What, what with Ludd starting up the whole lot with them-all, preaching that we should throw our technologies away. Don't you see?"
The spacer looks around a little unsteadily, then lowers their head to speak almost in a whisper.
"They was preparing us. For the invasion. We shut down them factories and ships and weapons and factories," a finger spins, showing you the whole terrible cycle of betrayal. "Ya'see? Because you- if you look close, they say Ludd was never caught on holovid, but I seen things. Ludd was one of 'em. A cyborg-AI-robot whats'it. And there're others. Left behind to be leading us astray. You know whaddit means?"

The graying spacer gives you an apologetic smile, salutes, and slips unsteadily away.

gaFC Fikenhild, Adonya Coureuse
------------------------------
[Line 4424] [Option Selected: Visit Adonya Coureuse in the overcity]
You stand for a moment taking in the bewildering signage of the Kay-arco transport matrix before you shrug and allow your TriPad to select the best route to the home of Adonya Coureuse. 
Cyclopean arcology substructure flashes by as you ride the primary ring tube to a far segment of the metroplex; a small passenger lift fills with the smell of sweat and machine oil of a shift of undersea laborers returning home; glimpses of the towering arms of Kay-arco flash by, glittering with thousands of windows.  

[Line 4424] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildAdonya2:Continue]

[Line 4425] [Option Selected: Continue]
You find yourself guided through the heart of a residential stack, through a quiet plaza filled with retirees and well-tended foliage, then before you is the door of Adonya Coureuse.
You press the door chime, and barely get out your excuse for the visit before being invited in.
Adonya is more than pleased to have a visitor and, despite your protests, has a cup of tea cooling in your hand before you quite know what's happening.

[Line 4425] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildAdonya3:Continue]

[Line 4426] [Option Selected: Continue]
You have only to bring up her daughter to get Adonya talking. "The girl is too clever for her own good. Just like her father." Adonya shakes her head at an old memory, but speaks of Scylla with pride. "The man who visited last time said that was all the questions they had, didn't they find anything? ... But look at you!" She admires your uniform, "Are you also from Fleet?"
You manage to avoid answering that question; Adonya has a holo-feed of the King of Westernesse holding court set to half-volume and switches effortlessly between commenting on the proceedings and questioning you about personal matters: you hedge on your precise age, admit to operating a space $shipOrFleet, and leave your marital status vague. She doesn't seem to mind your non-answers.
Finally you get the chance to ask a question of your own.

[Line 4426] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildAdonyaA:"Who was it that was asking about Scylla before me?"
gaFC_fikenhildAdonyaB:"Do you know where I can find Scylla?"
gaFC_fikenhildAdonyaC:Just make sure you're seen by any observers]

[Line 4427] [Option Selected: "Who was it that was asking about Scylla before me?"]
Adonya continues watching some scandal involving the King of Westernesse. "That man from League Fleet- or was it MuniSec? Oh, you people can never get your records straight. It's that new king- so impressive at first, but if you only play to locals, the bigwigs on Kazeron will take you by the so-and-so, that's what I say. Give this scandal another week and everyone will say 'Adonya, you were right about everything.'
"Anyway, what was his name, Finlay something? He left a comms chip in case I had more questions. And I called, but it was an automated response, can you believe that? So I threw it away. Let him apologize in person." She smiles, "I like you much better." 
You nod agreeably. An agent named Finlay. Probably working for the Persean League's intelligence service. Interesting.

[Line 4427] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildAdonyaLeave:Time to leave]

[Line 4428] [Option Selected: "Do you know where I can find Scylla?"]
You wait for a lull in the noise and ask your question a little louder than intended. Adonya gives you a corrective look before turning back to her holovid. The King of Westernesse is haranguing a panel of aquanomists.
"It's political, isn't it?" Adonya says after a moment. "Scylla finally found real trouble. I always told her that Cavin boy was bad news, but she'd say it was 'just art stuff'. I may be her mother, but I'm not stupid." She gestures intensely at the holovid, a splash of tea exiting her cup, "That's a capering twit if ever there was one, but at least no one is dying in some fool street fight."
She sighs, "If only Scylla had settled down with Elissa. You can be content making a ripple instead of a splash. I told her father that once, and he had the sense to listen."

[Line 4428] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildAdonyaB2:"Who is Elissa?"]

[Line 4429] [Option Selected: "Who is Elissa?"]
"Ah," Adonya looks rather pleased now, "You fancy spies with your titles and gadgets didn't figure her out?" She laughs, "And now you've got to ask an old woman for help? Oh don't worry," she says, setting her tea down, "I'll tell you, captain."
 
"Elissa Zal. Such a nice girl. Could have been the best thing that ever happened to Scylla. But," she shakes her head, "an offer from the Galatia Academy came first. Full scholarship from the office of the Provost. Sikar was thrilled; his little scientist got the chance he never had."
She trails off, with a sad look.

[Line 4429] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildAdonyaB3:"Do you have a comms id for Elissa Zal?"]

[Line 4430] [Option Selected: "Do you have a comms id for Elissa Zal?"]
"Oh, let me think," Adonya says. "No... no, it's been so many years." She gives you a sly smile, "But we could ask." 
"TriHome," she says loudly. An expectant chime sounds from the holo-vid entertainment system as the King of Westernesse is muted. "Comms id for Elissa Zal, please.
"Searching," says TriHome, then a pause. "No Elissa Zal found in local system."
Adonya looks disappointed, and mutters "Stupid thing." She looks at you again, "Do you need more tea, dear?"
It feels about like the time you should leave, though you surreptitiously add the name "Elissa Zal" to your list of persons-of-interest.

[Line 4430] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildAdonyaLeave:Time to leave]

[Line 4431] [Option Selected: Just make sure you're seen by any observers]
You interrupt Adonya's critique of one of the King's 'water-brained' advisors to compliment the view from the balcony. Adonya takes the bait and invites you to have your tea outdoors. The holovid's volume is reduced to a muttered cacophony as you step into the high sea air.
Banks of windows and balconies flow across the facing towers. Drones buzz in ordered lines, diverting to deliver packages or attend to cleaning. Adonya explains the generous terms of her lease compared to those offered by other towers and asks if you've considered retiring to Fikenhild. You smile and nod, turning this way and that for the thousands of cameras that are probably capturing your image. If anyone is watching, they will know you were here.

Having completed what you came here for, you make your apologies to Adonya Coureuse as you move to leave, assuring her that you will find Scylla and see that she is safe. And yes, you will absolutely comms if any new information comes up.
The door softly closes behind you, leaving your ears free of the holovid's incessant murmur - and the endless probing questions from Adonya. Reaching for your datapad, you discover that you're still holding a cup of cold tea. You carefully set it in front of the door before leaving.

gaFC Fikenhild, Bione Lata
------------------------------
[Line 4434] [Option Selected: Visit Bione Lata in the exurbs]
You take a transport line outbound to the Kay-arco exurbs, a sprawling network of floating municipalities jostling in the sea at the base of the mighty half-submerged arcology. The monorail track gleams in the sun, a straight line toward the horizon like a hardpoint-mounted particle lance shot through a nebula.
The train breaks through a cloudbank, and you feel the subtle pull of deceleration fighting with the agrav field effect as you approach your target: a modular suburban conglomeration. You glance at your TriPad to recall the name of the place, 'Seabank Oasis'.

[Line 4434] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildBione2:Continue]

[Line 4435] [Option Selected: Continue]
You buzz at the doorway to one of the outer compounds, the green hint of lawn showing through the translucent vitreous strip at the top of the wall. After a short delay, a commsplate activates and a tired-looking woman appears in holo. You ask if you are speaking with Bione Lata, and would she mind answering some questions about Scylla Coureuse.
She looks behind her, then lowers her voice to reply. "Yes. Didn't someone already come by to ask about her? I haven't seen Scylla in years, like I said. Look, I don't have much time for this."

[Line 4436] [Options Given: 0:gaFC_fikenhildBioneA:"Can you tell me about Scylla herself?"]

30:gaFC_fikenhildBioneD:Just make sure you're seen by any observers]

[Line 4440] [Option Selected: "Can you tell me about Scylla herself?"]
"Okay. Like I said, I don't know what she got mixed up with. When I knew Sy, she... worked hard. Good grades. No, great grades. Unless she thought the teacher was wrong, and then," Bione smiles now, "She wouldn't stand down."
"And I don't know, she was pretty serious with Elissa - um, Elissa Zal, like I told the other agent. Something happened, I don't know what. She hung out in the lower city more, with that Cavin guy. Got into all kinds of trouble. Then-" You hear the thin wail of an infant from both the commsplate and over the compound wall. "I really have to go now- goodbye agent... whatever your name is."

[Line 4441] [Option Selected: ['gaFC_questionBioneAend', '!$global.gaFC_knowElissasName', '$elissaAside']]
Elissa Zal. This name is a new connection. You make a quick note on your TriPad.

[Line 4442] [Option Selected: ['gaFC_questionBioneAend', '$global.gaFC_knowElissasName']]
The commsplate clicks off, replacing Bione's face with the dancing Seabank Oasis mascot, which reminds you that unregistered guests will be asked to leave the exurb at the end of the workshift.

[Line 4442] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildBioneLeave:Leave]

[Line 4443] [Option Selected: "Who exactly came by before and questioned you?"]
"Oh, um, that was a couple weeks ago. Finlay?" She thinks for a moment.
"Oh, you mean Agent Siyavong with Fleet intelligence. Finlay was his first name. You must be from Munisec, right?"

[Line 4443] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildBioneB2:Make a noncommittal motion, possibly a nod]

[Line 4444] [Option Selected: Make a noncommittal motion, possibly a nod]
"That makes sense, League departments never coordinate with domestic services, do they. Well, it's not my fault you people never talk to each other. Agent Siyavong left a commskey."
"Here," she taps at something, and an id glyph appears. As you use your TriPad to pull the contact info, you hear the thin wail of an infant from both the commsplate and over the compound wall. "I really have to go now- goodbye agent, um, didn't catch your name- sorry!"
The commsplate clicks off, replacing Bione's face with the dancing Seabank Oasis mascot. You glance at the new comms contact on your TriPad, one Finlay Siyavong.

[Line 4444] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildBioneLeave:Leave]

[Line 4445] [Option Selected: "Tell me about this 'Agent Finlay' who spoke with you."]
"Oh, um, that was a couple weeks ago. He was very nice, well dressed." She smiles, then tries to hide it. "Agent Finlay... Finlay Siyavong. He was with Fleet Intelligence. You're from Fleet too, right?" 
You make a noncommittal motion that could be interpreted quite broadly.
"He asked a lot of questions. Can't you just ask him? I really am right in the middle of- " You hear the thin wail of an infant from both the commsplate and over the compound wall. "I have to go now. Sorry agent. Goodbye."
The commsplate shuts off, replacing Bione's face with the dancing Seabank Oasis mascot. An agent Finlay Siyavong. Probably working for the Persean League's intelligence service. Interesting.

[Line 4445] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildBioneLeave:Leave]

[Line 4446] [Option Selected: Just make sure you're seen by any observers]
You take a step back and speak with your loud, carrying 'commander voice': first you assure Bione that you're simply following up on 'the agency's' previous visit, and that she is speaking to $playerName, by the way. You carefully enunciate your name so that there's no confusion about how to input it into a search query, whether by voice or text.
Pacing in front of the commsplate, you mention Scylla Coureuse again, but speak mostly about yourself and the patriotic importance of being forthright with officials. A neighbor pokes their head out a window from the next unit over with an upset look at the noise, but retreats as soon as you make eye contact.
You have such a show going that it takes a moment for you to realize that Bione's voice coming through the tinny commsplate is trying to get your attention.

[Line 4446] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildBioneD2:See what she wants]

[Line 4447] [Option Selected: See what she wants]
"Hello! Um, $playerFirstName was it? Can you keep it down? My-" You hear the thin wail of an infant from both the commsplate and over the compound wall.
Bione's look hardens; you've done it this time. "...I really have to go. Good bye."
The commsplate shuts off, replacing Bione's face with the dancing Seabank Oasis mascot. It reminds you to keep your voice down while visiting the exurb community, and won't you have a nice day.
You nod, and turn around just in time to catch a different neighbor watching you with a look of consternation, datapad ready to call in a complaint.

[Line 4447] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildBioneLeave:Leave]

[Line 4448] [Option Selected: Leave]
You turn back toward the monorail line, subvocalizing an update to your mission notes. A fog bank rolls in, dimming the bright sun.

gaFC Fikenhild, Cavin Pharoh
------------------------------
[Line 4450] [Option Selected: Visit Cavin Pharoh in the undercity]
The transit lift descends into the subsurface districts of Kay-arco. The air thickens with mildew and century-old machine lubricant. You pass through structural tunnels filled with cheap tenements, gray market retailers, and fringe ideologies.
Your TriPad's directions lead you to an address where Cavin Pharoh held what the event notice called a 'militant consciousness happening'. Along an anonymous stretch of shuttered depot-fronts you discover a secure door flanked by decaying polymer agitation prints. Chemmed out sleepers lie in entryways. It feels like the right place.

[Line 4452] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildCavinKnock:Knock on the door]

[Line 4453] [Option Selected: Continue]
As you raise your hand to knock, the commsplate by the door sputters to life and speaks.
"You've made your point, $playerName." 
An officious voice, though distorted by the damaged commsplate. It signals an elite education and the relaxed authority which comes naturally to its speaker. 
"You want us to know you're looking for Scylla Coureuse and you're going to shout it from every street corner on Fikenhild until we acknowledge it."

[Line 4454] [Option Selected: Continue]
As you raise your hand to knock, the commsplate by the door sputters to life and speaks.

As you raise your hand to knock, the commsplate by the door sputters to life and speaks.
"Demarchon $playerName. I apologize for delaying my response the inquiry you made through official channels." 
An officious voice, though distorted by the damaged commsplate. It signals an elite education and the relaxed authority which comes naturally to its speaker. 
"You're looking for someone quite specific, and I should like to assist you."

"We should bring this conversation to a more discreet setting," the voice continues. "I'll transmit my comms ID for you to contact. Leave this nest of anarchists be. Come back topside and let us speak face to face about our mutual interest." 
The commsplate sputters and dies with a lingering crackle as your datapad pings. It looks like you finally attracted the official attention you were looking for.

[Line 4464] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildCavinLeave:Leave - you got what you need
gaFC_fikenhildCavinKnockAnyway:Knock on the door anyway]

[Line 4466] [Option Selected: Knock on the door]
The damaged commsplate by the door speaks with a crackle, "-re you MuniSec? We do not consent to a search! Not without-", then some muffled words, and a second voice interrupts, "Shut up. I'll handle it." 
Hidden bolts withdraw and a man steps out. He's put on a sour scowl for you and is dressed in a mix of dirtsider approximation of spacer gear mixed with the accoutrement of some local counterculture fashion. He pulls the door closed and with a lowered voice says "Ignore that. Is she in more trouble? This is about the whole Galatia thing isn't it?"

[Line 4466] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildCavinIntro:"I assume you're Cavin Pharoh?"]

[Line 4467] [Option Selected: "I assume you're Cavin Pharoh?"]
"Yeah. Obviously." He looks you over. "You're not MuniSec or Fleet. You a merc? Or some kinda spy? Your friend was already sniffing around here. We told him to go lick boots on Kazeron."
Cavin crosses his arms impatiently and looks off down the arco-tube, making every effort to show that he doesn't want to talk. "Well?"

Cavin considers you for a moment. "So you're not working with him huh?" He slaps the commsplate, "Hear that, vat-pig? Not Fleet. You lose."
He turns back to you. "Uh... let'see, it was Finlay. Agent Finlay something. He tried to appeal to my 'patriotism as a citizen of the League' and flashed his FleetInt ID at me. Ha! What a soulless minion of orthodoxy." 
FleetInt- he means the Persean League intelligence apparatus. Interesting.

[Line 4474] [Option Selected: Continue]
"I don't know what you're playing at, uh, captain whatever your name is. You shouldn't be talking to me. It's dangerous." He puffs out his chest a bit at this, eager to bear the label 'dangerous'. 
"Look, a free bit of advice. If you know what's good for you - and Scylla - you'd get off this planet. So don't come back looking for me, okay?"
Cavin slaps the commsplate, unlatching the door bolts. He turns back to you for a moment, but thinks better of it and disappears into the structure.

[Line 4474] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildCavinLeave:Continue]

[Line 4475] [Option Selected: "I want to help Scylla. Do you know where she is?"]
Cavin raises his chin, defiant. "I'd like to believe that. I told Scylla she couldn't sell out to the Galatia Academy without... making compromises." He says the word like it's a curse. "They'd either get in her head, or, or... " his jaw clenches.
He takes a breath, looks down, then continues quietly, "She thought she was onto something bigger than all this, you know. Change the world. Get us out of a closing trap. The Persean Sector, I mean, and all the wars and ruin. I don't know if I believe it. But if anyone could come up with, with something, I don't know what, it'd be Scylla."

[Line 4476] [Option Selected: Continue]
"I gotta go. You shouldn't be talking to me. If anyone knows where she is, maybe it's Elissa."
He looks around, then puts his body between you and the commsplate, and holds out a knockoff datapad displaying a comms ID glyph. He stays silent, but his look is almost pleading. You quickly scan the glyph with your TriPad, which makes a satisfied chime.

"It's not my place to say, but Elissa might know something. Ask her. Just ... don't come back here." Cavin slaps the commsplate, unlatching the door bolts.

[Line 4478] [Option Selected: "You know that the Fleet intel spies have your commsplate hacked, right?"]
At your words, Cavin turns to look at the commsplate in horror. It crackles- Cavin pulls back with a start as it speaks in the second voice you heard, not the officious Fleet agent.
"I told you they're watching us! I told you!"
"Shut up!" Cavin pounds the commsplate with a fist, "And stop listening in, creep!" He turns back to you. "Who are you anyway? Why would you tell me this?"

Cavin looks at you, confused. "Hey, I don't know what you're playing at. I don't know any agent or whatever-" The commsplate crackles an interruption, "I told you they were a spy, Cavin! I win!"
He pounds the commsplate behind him, "They're not fleet, idiot!" And back to you, "I don't want any part of this. Tell your friend Finlay to go lick boots on Kazeron."

[Line 4483] [Option Selected: Continue]
The commsplate crackles, "Yeah, tell 'em Cavin! Go suck vacuum fashy-worm!"
Cavin slaps the commsplate and the bolts withdraw. Cavin backs into the doorway. "Don't come looking for me again. I won't be here."
The door slams shut, sending a ripple through the polymer agit-prints surrounding the door. A flurry of plastic flakes flit to the ground.

"I gotta go. You shouldn't be talking to me. I- If anyone knows where Scylla is, maybe it's Elissa." He looks around, puts his body between you and the commsplate, and holds out a knockoff datapad with a comms ID glyph displayed. He nods to you in earnest. You quickly scan the glyph and your TriPad makes a satisfied chime to itself.

You clear your throat and then speak rather too loudly, "Cavin Pharoh. I know that you are an associate of Scylla Coureuse. I would like you to answer some questions for my investigation, please"
The commsplate behind Cavin crackles and speaks, "Cavin! I told you they were a FleetSec agent, I told you! Don't tell them anything!"

[Line 4486] [Options Given: gaFC_fikenhildCavinE2:Continue]

[Line 4487] [Option Selected: Continue]
Cavin goes pale, looking like a trapped animal. He smacks the commsplate behind him and hisses "Shut up!" then turns back to you, "And you- shut up too! I don't... I don't know you, I don't know anything. Don't talk to me!" Back to the commsplate, "Open up, this is some kind of crazy person."
The bolts withdraw and Cavin backs into the doorway. "Stay away from me!" he shouts one last time before the door slams shut sending a ripple through the polymer agit-prints surrounding the door. A flurry of plastic flakes flit to the ground.

[Line 4492] As you start to turn away from the dismal portico, the commsplate crackles one more time. It speaks. "You've made your point, $playerName." 
An officious voice, though distorted by the damaged commsplate. It signals an elite education and a relaxed authority that comes naturally to its speaker.

"$playerName," Zal says when the feed finally stabilizes, "I thought you might contact me."

"It is my understanding that League intel has you on your way to meet Sylla for their own reasons. I would advise you not to trust their intentions. If you must go through with it, leave poor Cavin out. He's," the image pauses thoughtfully somewhat before the audio catches up, "He's a good kid."

The image of Zal flickers slightly.
"Captain, I've decided that I will help you. Now I did make a promise to Scylla, so... let's just say that if I were you, I'd follow in the path of Leonis."

"Finally, we may speak directly. Finlay Siyavong, at your service."

[Line 4536] "Demarchon $playerName." His tone is respectful, perhaps with a note of amusement.
"Finally, we may speak directly. Finlay Siyavong, at your service."

[Line 4537] "$playerName. I am Finlay Siyavong; finally we may speak directly. And discreetly." He lowers his head, his expression hardening, "A skill, alongside tact, which you would do well to practice."
He looks aside, "You have a way of complicating matters, such as a certain surveillance operation in the Kay-arco undercity. Let me emphasize- " he stops himself. "No, let us speak to the matter at hand."

[Line 4538] "Demarchon $playerName. I am Finlay Siyavong; finally we may speak directly. And discreetly." He lowers his head, his expression hardening somewhat, "A skill, alongside tact, which I would expect a demarchon of the League would better appreciate."
He looks aside. "There's a risk of complicating matters. Such as a certain surveillance operation in the Kay-arco undercity. Let me emphasize- " he stops himself.
"No, I apologize. I shall speak only to the matter at hand."

[Line 4539] "I am Finlay Siyavong, though you have made it quite clear that you know this already and are eager to display that knowledge in front of persons of interest to the Service." 
"Let me be clear. The League guarantees certain rights to intersystem merchants, though it is a stretch to ascribe you even that status considering your 'colorful' record. Even if you display no respect for this institution and my explicit requests from you, I cannot simply lock you up." He folds his arms, and leans back. "As much as I would like to."
"But we have a more important matter to discuss, don't we $playerName."

[Line 4540] "I am Finlay Siyavong, though you have made it quite clear that you know this already and are eager to display that knowledge to persons of interest to the Service." 
"Let me be clear. As demarchon you are given a certain leeway. And even if you display zero respect for our shared institutions and my explicit requests not to divulge confidential information, I cannot simply lock you up." He folds his arms, and leans back. "As much as I would like to."
"But we have a more important matter to discuss, don't we Demarchon $playerName."

[Line 4541] "I am Finlay Siyavong, though you have made it quite clear that you know this already and are eager to display that knowledge in front of persons of interest to the service." 
"With all due respect to your position within the League," he says, carefully removing you as an individual from the remit of his comment, "I advise that such a casual attitude toward matters of interfactional security are... unbecoming, and decidedly unhelpful to our shared long-term strategic well-being." He folds his arms, and leans back. "I understand that, technically, I work for you. But please don't make my job harder than it is."
"Setting that aside, we have important matter to discuss, Demarchon $playerName."

[Line 4547] [Option Selected: "It took you long enough to contact me."]
"Yes, we've been watching you for some time." Siyavong lifts a datapad and makes a show of reading it. "You've enjoyed a rather fascinating career lately, captain. You seem to have a knack for finding trouble, and for trouble finding you." 
He puts down the datapad. "It's provided much fodder for the analysts."  
"To be perfectly honest," he says, and smiles just a little, "I had hoped I would not find it necessary to speak with you so directly. But you've forced my hand, so here we are."

[Line 4548] [Option Selected: "It took you long enough to contact me."]
"Ah. It took some time for the message to get through the... not quite the proper channels, of course..." Siyavong puts on a sly look for a moment. "I wouldn't say I expected you to reach out so directly, but perhaps I should have."
He lifts a datapad and taps its face. "You've enjoyed a fascinating career lately, demarchon. You have a knack for finding trouble, and for trouble finding you. It's provided much fodder for the analysts."  
He sets the datapad down.
"To be perfectly honest," he begins, with an ironic hint of smile, "I had hoped we wouldn't have to speak at all. It'd be cleaner. But my hand was forced and here we are."

[Line 4550] [Option Selected: "Where is Scylla Coureuse?"]
"A rather direct question to ask an agent of the service, don't you think?" Agent Siyavong seems genuinely amused. "But that is the heart of the matter, and your profile suggests a certain propensity for, shall we say, direct thinking."
"Let me answer you with a question," he says, leaning in.

He looks at you, curiously, his brow creased. "Interesting," he says to himself, "Direct."
"Is that really what you believe?" he muses, then waves the question away, "No need to respond to that. You've given me much to think about. Meanwhile - there's important business to get to: saving Scylla Coureuse." He grins like this is a shared joke.
"Coureuse is in the Isirah system, of course. I will provide you-" he pauses dramatically as he taps something out on his desk console; your TriPad pings, "-with a plausible-looking data intercept of a communication between her and Mr. Cavin Pharoh."

Siyavong's smile widens, "If I didn't, did you just confirm it?"

Agent Siyavong looks like he's having fun; now you're playing his game.
"Well, $playerName, I happen to be one of these other people. She is important- or, more precisely, she could be important if she is given the correct opportunity."
He leans in, and says softly, "There are those who would like her to remain insignificant. Possibly forever. I think... we should not let it be that way. I suspect your 'other person' agrees with me on this point, if little else."

He puts his hands together, not quite hiding his grin. "Provost Baird will be pleased, I'm sure."

[Line 4567] [Option Selected: "I'm helping Provost Anahita Baird with some kind of secret project."]
Agent Siyavong blinks, and frowns as if he didn't expect you to simply come out and say it.
"I must admit that your forthrightness is somewhat disturbing."
"I advise you to be mindful of who you share your words with," he says sternly, "Particularly in consideration of what you're about to learn."

Siyavong pauses, showing no emotion or movement at all. You almost wonder if the comms feed has frozen, then he speaks. "I am interested, captain. Shall we make it a trade? Zal's comms ID for the location of Scylla Coureuse?
He smiles now.

Siyavong studies his TriPad. "Fascinating," he says, then looks up, setting it aside.

[Line 4570] [Option Selected: "As a demarchon of the League, you work for me. Remember?"]
Agent Siyavong blinks, frowning at your directness
"You are forthright, captain. I'm afraid, with apologies, that the report heirarchy doesn't quite work like that. You may, of course, submit an official request to the FIS through proper channels. Though I hear there's something of a backlog."
His smirk is almost deniable. He lets you wait for just a moment before this would register as insolence, then continues.
"Nonetheless, as I'm sure you're aware, we in the League pride ourselves on a certain spirit of dynamism and cooperation which sets us apart from, say, the Hegemony."

[Line 4599] Your $shipOrFleet approaches the probe. It is not transmitting an active transponder ID, but when your comms officer performs a direct transponder ping, the return identifies the probe as property of the Galatia Academy. This is followed by a block of legal language threatening fines and alluding to unspecified dangers inherent in tampering with said property. 
You suspect that these mere words, a ghost of an EM pulse sent across cold vacuum, would dissuade few of the outer systems scavengers you've crossed paths with.

The probe hull is empty aside from dangling rough-cut ends of conduits. Someone has completely cleaned out the internal hardware chassis.
"It wasn't long ago," your sensors officer reports. "Radar sweep for debris spread from intrusion incident shows minimal spread. Whoever did this, they're probably still in-system."
In system. With the probe hardware you need.

[Line 4605] A salvage crew is dispatched under your operations chief's watchful eye. Using codes provided by Provost Baird, the team opens the probe to install a short-range relay which allows your technicians full reign of the probe's data environment.
Tech reports feed active; the probe's hull is sealed with a few quick bursts of a plasma torch. Your ops chief recalls the salvage crew.

[Line 4606] [Option Selected: Get a sitrep from the tech team]
You meet your tech officer in a briefing room. They've already unfolded a portable workstation and connected a holoprojector to present findings.
The probe contains a cluster of redundant cores grouped into a small network; a holo-cloud of connected glyphs rotates slowly: navigation and stationholding thrusters; power supply and thermostability; rad sensors and civ-grade field emitters.
Tech finishes the overview, then with a sly smile sets half the icons aside and upscales the remaining, revealing sub-icons identifying particular research project packages. "Now here's the good stuff," they say.
Yellow warning glyphs denote packages that do not follow the Galatia Academy specs you have on-file.

[Line 4607] [Option Selected: Continue]
"What's most interesting is... this one," Tech says, bringing an unknown package into focus. "There's a modified hyperdrive core in there, the kind a very small starship might use." 
With a few key presses and a wave, the component icon explodes out into something like a glowing circuit diagram embedded in the shadow of the probe's schematics.
"It's like a hyperwave comms relay on combat stims." A tone of admiration emerges, "Beautiful work. No idea how they stabilize pulse strength on such cheap hardware."

Tech blinks, as if this was hardly a consideration in the light of such interesting engineering. "Um. It's not precisely a question of 'where' when we're speaking of hyperspace... "
You give the withering look which prompts what your underlings refer to behind your back as an 'executive summary'.
"What I mean to say is, we'll need to interface with a couple more probes like this to be able to pinpoint the transmission target within hyperspectral... we need to find two more probes. Then we'll know. $PlayerSirOrMadam."
One down, two to go.

[Line 4608] [Options Given: defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 4609] All crews perform their job with exemplary efficiency; your salvage team reports that an interface was successfully installed, and they've handed off control to your tech team who are already investigating the probe remotely. 
"Hyperwave analysis is not a merely linear process," your tech officer explains. "We will need one more data set to complete the... hmm, well it isn't triangulation, but you can think of it like that if it helps. Um."
They clear their throat. "Captain. $PlayerSirOrMadam."

"Um," the tech notices a certain time-sensitive implication in your voice. "This is good. Very good. We got a much more accurate read for the meta-array, which, um." Frantic tapping at a TriPad. 
"It looks like... an orbit somewhere in the Isirah system. Whoever is running these things, that's where their receiver is."

[Line 4612] [Options Given: gaFC_probeInvestigaitonWrapUp2:"What would this receiver look like?"]

[Line 4613] [Option Selected: "What would this receiver look like?"]
Your tech officer thinks for a moment.
"It wouldn't be as large as a normal comm array. There's very clever miniaturization here - fragile, yes, if stealth is the goal... Whoever built this used scavenged parts. Wild variety of sources. Maybe pirate? But more sophisticated than any pirate work I've seen."

"The receiver would show up as a neutrino source, just like any starship drive or civilian reactor. The hyperwave effects would be - well, it couldn't be placed somewhere populated, that's for sure. So this hyperwave comm relay would then tightbeam to the final receiver, whoever was listening, presumably. If we found the relay, we would know whoever is at the other end of this thing is nearby."
Stable orbit, neutrino source, uninhabited. The Isirah system.

[Line 4617] Your sensors officer reports that an ejected cargo pod floating in a spray of post-battle debris contains something that matches the mission target specifications.

[Line 4619] The scavenger captain flickers into your comm display.
"Greetings. Pardon my presumption, but I hope all is well? It's a long way back to the core worlds my friend, and we must look after one another."

"Ah..." The scavenger looks aside to avoid your gaze. "One finds all sorts of things out here and I, I couldn't really say if we did or not. I'd uh, have to have my assessor check the logs."
$HeOrShe shrugs with one shoulder, "Might take a while."

It doesn't take long.
Your comms officer interrupts your reverie. "Captain! Something in the scavenger flagship cargo hold just emitted a short range comms pulse. Seen this before, profile fits a Pather op. Maybe pirates."
A breath later, the comms hold signal switches to the distraught face of the scavenger captain.

"You didn't tell us it was trapped!" $heOrShe shouts in panic, "You should have said something, you should have- no, we need to get out of here. I'm ejecting the damn thing. Tell them I don't have it!"
The comms snap off.

"Oh, well now." The scavenger smiles, "Time is money, isn't it? And at faster than light speeds, my account books start doing funny things, ha-ha. I'm sure we could get some more of the crew checking cargo pods if there was some incentive... let's say $gaFC_bribeCost credits."

You authorize the credits transfer and can pin-point the moment it arrives because a wide smile breaks over the scavenger captain's face.
"Glad we could do business, captain. I've ordered my quartermaster to eject the cargo pod in question, so it's all yours," the scavenger says magnanimously. 
"Burn bright captain, I'm sure we'll meet again!" $HeOrShe closes the comms before you can comment on the uncannily speedy 'discovery' of the Galatia Academy probe.

"Oh, would you look at that, we did find something with Galatia Academy markings. Must have slipped my mind."
$HeOrShe looks at you accusingly, "Would've returned it once it was identified properly. You could have asked nicely. We gotta look out for each other out here, remember? Otherwise we're no better than pirates or the boot-licking Heggies."

"The desecrators return! You are a slave to Moloch, an addict to the knowledge denied you. You return here to tend your evil workings. And you dare," the Pather shouts in a frenzy now, "You dare to knock at the door of the Creator! Who are you, Galatian?"

[Line 4647] The comms open.
"Captain $playerName," the mercenary captain speaks flatly, hands steepled before $himOrHer. "You have information which my employer would like you to share with them. Exclusively."
Then $heOrShe waits, perfectly content to let the silence grow.

$HeOrShe raises $hisOrHer eyebrows. "I think you know perfectly well. You came here to find something," a small smile, "Or someone."
"You appear to be traveling with purposeful intent after investigative activity at your last stop. My employer believes that you found what you were looking for and would like you to share that information under exclusive terms."

[Line 4655] [Option Selected: "Let's talk about making a deal."]
"Yes, let's. My employer has authorized me to pay you $gaFC_sellOutPrice credits for the transfer of the information you possess which is relevant to the current location of Scylla Coureuse."

You accede to the terms and oversee transfer of the records of your investigation into the current location of Scylla Coureuse - the Isirah System. The mercenary is terse but comprehensive in $hisOrHer oversight of the proceeding, which is soon concluded.
"I shall authorize the credits transfer immediately. My employer will find this acceptable. Our business is complete, captain."
The comms signal is terminated by the mercenary.

"Captain, there are things money simply can't buy."
Is that a hint of some expression on the merc's face? It is difficult to tell.
"Let me put it like this," $heOrShe says. "If you were in a position to purchase my services, you would not be in the position you are in. Therefore, your proposal is quite impossible."

"Oh," the merc tilts $hisOrHer head a few degrees to one side. "Did I make a threat?"

[Line 4661] [Option Selected: "Who exactly is this employer?"]
"My employer." The merc crosses $hisOrHer arms.
"-Who is interested in exclusive access to your information. Who also... has a passion for discretion, so you need not worry about your reputation if you sold out your own employer." $HeOrShe considers. "Much."

[Line 4662] [Option Selected: "Then you'll get nothing from me."]
After your reply, the mercenary sits unmoving for a full ten seconds.
Then $heOrShe closes $hisOrHer eyes and nods $hisOrHer head. "I see."
The merc opens $hisOrHer eyes again, and looks at you again, unblinking. "How disappointing. Good shift, captain."

She sighs, and raises her eyes briefly to the firmament, such as it is. "Very well..."
"If your information can be trusted, it may be effective to simply confront the local authorities with that knowledge and see what you might ascertain." She's gone into full lecture mode. "Bluff, perhaps. Competing authorities in-system might have knowledge of the activities of their counterparts; intel and counter-intel. Those less scrupulous might be bribed - and before you ask, I believe we've paid you quite enough already to carry out this mission one way or another without another creative entry for the bursar's office."

She stops, and faces you, "Not every problem can be solved with direct application of force," a slight smile appears, "All knowledge, perhaps, is the result of this human frustration. Now, go. You will be rewarded once I am in contact with Scylla Coureuse."

[Line 4677] [Option Selected: Search the station for a makeshift hypercomm receiver]
You assemble your senior officers to discuss the matter of the Coureuse-related hypercomms directed at the Isirah System. A preliminary scan of the Groombridge Habitat rotates slowly in the holoprojector's display. 
"Theoretically," your nav officer says, "A hyperspace-interacting field could be pulsed only periodically. It'd be impossible to detect unless we caught it at the right moment. And we don't know the schedule."

[Line 4677] [Options Given: gaFC_groombridgeSearch2:Continue]

[Line 4678] [Option Selected: Continue]
Comms speaks up, "The same principle could be applied to the intra-system relay. Data could be cached, then pulsed to a habitat, ship, another relay..." 
Your ops chief speaks, "-And that reactor shootin' rads like it is, no one would look too close. Or hang around long. Only way to search is," a thoughtful pause, "Rad-armored drones. One-way trip. If a relay is in there, it'll have a damn strong rad-shield."

At the turn of the next shift the armored drones are prepared, and your ops chief oversees their deployment. You follow their progress through the projection of Groombridge Habitat, filling in fuzzy volumes - shielded from your scans or too radioactive to get a good read - with sharp details. An anomalous shielded mass is found soon enough in a damaged work bay in close proximity to the deadly core of the station.  
Tech and comms begin discussing how to breach and hack the relay; your ops chief growls an interruption, "If I were them, I'd rig it to blow if it got looked at funny." The other officers go quiet.
Sensors speaks up, "We just have to intercept an in-system signal, right? Assuming it's tightcast, we could deploy a, um, cloud of detectors." Your ops chief looks at your sensors officer and sighs.


[Line 4680] [Options Given: gaFC_groombridgeSearch5:"Do it."]

Within hours of establishing a makeshift detection cloud, the relay sends a comms squirt. The whiff of an outbound signal is projected by your navigator on your flagship bridge main holodisplay, the line points toward Laicaille Habitat. Not quite, but close enough. Maybe a relay in a close orbit.

You assemble your senior officers to discuss the matter of secret comms bursts directed at the Isirah System. A preliminary scan of the Groombridge Habitat rotates slowly in the holoprojector's display. 
"Why here? I mean, rhetorically speaking," your nav officer says, "Because the only reason to relay signals from here to Laicaille is if your signals were coming from a hidden hypercomm relay."
Your comms officer raises a hand, and at your nod speaks, "It's unconventional. But Groombridge is uninhabited, so no one would complain about hyperwave wash."
Your ops chief speaks next, "The reactor shootin' rads like it is, no one would look too close. No scavengers."

Within hours of establishing a makeshift detection cloud, the relay sends a comms squirt. The whiff of an outbound signal is projected by your navigator on your flagship bridge main holodisplay, the line points toward Laicaille Habitat. Not quite, but close enough. Maybe a relay in a close orbit.
This is the sort of tech Coureuse is familiar with, and even if it is arguably circumstantial, it's a weird enough setup that you can probably scare the authorities at Laicaille with the revelation.
Ghosties indeed.

"Very funny, captain... $playerName. Because it looks to me more like if you'd got yourself the chance, you'd turn me in to the closest League fleet for a handful of credits and a pat on the head." $HeOrShe drops the datapad with a clatter.
"If that's how it is, that's how it is. I don't expect anything more, and I'll shoot you down myself if you step out of line on my station. But don't pretend to be my friend when you're nothing but a fawning bootlicker when an official patrol comes sniffing around."

"I may have heard something from someone. It's my business, right, knowing who's making the moves in the Isirah system, and to who." 
$HeOrShe leans close to the comms pick-up, and speaks quietly "Word is the Persean League started asking a lot of questions about someone named 'Coureuse', and that was because the Hegemony started asking around first."

[Line 4702] [Options Given: gaFC_kapteynBossInfoDump2:"And?"]

[Line 4703] [Option Selected: "And?"]
"And then just about all at once the League snitches all stopped asking about Coureuse. That tells me, $firstName, it looks like someone found who they were looking for. It also tells me they're not a real experienced operation. Leave it to the League, right? Appointing offices by influence more than ability. I'd never abide by that."

"I paid a real professional surveillance contractor and they got me list of names, rented properties, and schedule of activities. Looks like they've got some fancy safehouse set-up." The Pirate boss taps a datapad and your comms ping to alert you to an incoming file. "You've bought yourself a copy of the data, my friend."

gaFC ask around the bar on Laicaille
------------------------------
[Line 4710] You ask around about the missing academician, buying moderately priced drinks to lubricate the flow of information. This is a spacer bar, and though spacers try to look out for one another, you're finding little in the way of leads, mostly shrugs and apologies.
"I'm sorry you're having trouble finding your friend," says an off-shift dockworker in a utilitarian vacsuit liner. "I shall pray for your reunion."

The dockworker's expression shuts down instantly. "I am not a 'Pather', $playerSirOrMadam. I do follow the teachings of the Church of Galactic Redemption and I'd thank you not to make bigoted assumptions. We are not all fanatics and terrorists."
They stand, leaving an untouched drink. "Blessings of Ludd be upon all souls, both large and small," they say, and stomp away.

[Line 4713] [Options Given: backToBar:Return to the bar]

[Line 4715] The station technicians, in grungy Laicaille Habitat jumpsuits, respond well to your offer to buy them a round and listen to their troubles. You mention having had comms disruption in an ion storm once and ask what sort of trouble they're having.
"It's strange," says the big one, "There's no real pattern to it. Every few shifts, it just goes zap. Lots of noise gumming up some of the orbital beacons. Bossman makes us go out and check the beacon, and it's nothing. Lotta fooling around for no reason, I say."
"Not no ion storm either, we'd know that," says the smaller partner. "Ain't no natural wossit." 

[Line 4715] [Options Given: gaFCLaicaille_barEvent3:"What do you think it is?"]

"Ghosties," says the big one, eyes wide.
The smaller one sighs and mumbles under their breath "...Ludd's sake..."
The big one looks annoyed, "No, let me tell it. I told you I wouldn't run your ear about it anymore, but the captain here asked nicely."

"It's all them people that died in Groombridge when the reactor went critical," the big one says. "No, not went critical. Was made critical. 'Cause it was murder."
"They got no peace, see, 'cause it wasn't a clean death and there's no justice. So they're calling out for someone to help. That's what it is, a signal from Groombridge."
The small one speaks up quietly, "...can't know that."

[Line 4718] [Option Selected: "How do you know the interference is coming from Groombridge?"]
"Directional receiver." The big one looks proud.
"Yeah, but," the small one interjects, "I gotta remind you to reset the alignment origin on that thing half the time when we're out checking beacons. The noise could be from anywhere, could be anything. Some pulsar or something."

"Well, no," the small one sputters, "I'm just saying as an example. Anyway," they check their datapad, "We gotta get back on-shift. Bottoms-up!"
The techs finish their drinks, give you their regards, and head out. You don't find their mixture of work and intemperance particularly reassuring, but maybe there is something weird going on at Groombridge Habitat. If someone really is sending secret encrypted signals...

gaFC ask around the bar on Kapteyn
------------------------------
[Line 4723] You ask around about the missing academician, buying moderately priced drinks to lubricate the flow of information. This is a pirate bar, and despite their well-known enthusiasm for free booze, pirates are loathe to speak openly to anyone asking too many questions.
A shady character at the bar wearing an expensive but worn-looking coat accepts your drink. "They think you're the Sector's dumbest undercover cop, you know."
"But I know you're not," $gaFC_KBAheOrShe takes a long sip. "A cop, that is. I saw your $shipOrFleet come in, ran some queries. It's my business, you know."

[Line 4723] [Options Given: gaFCKapteyn_barEvent2:"And what business is that?"]

[Line 4725] [Option Selected: "Then I've come to the right person."]
$gaFC_KBAHeOrShe smiles slyly, "Indeed you have."
"Problem is, I've sold that knowledge and my customer might take issue if I were to distribute it without respect for our, ah, understanding of the exclusive utility of that knowledge. My customer is very important around here, if you catch my meaning. Now, if you were to approach that customer directly to work something out, you might come away with something useful."

gaFC_kapteynBarDone:"Thanks. Enjoy your drink."]

[Line 4730] [Option Selected: "Doesn't that cut you out of the loop? What about your profit?"]
$gaFC_KBAHeOrShe shrugs. "It's long-term planning, y'see. If you show up asking questions, it confirms that my customer made a wise purchase. Comes up they need to find something out, they come back to me."
"Long-term planning, my friend. That's the difference between these deadbeat pirate lackeys and myself. I'm going to big places."

[Line 4731] [Option Selected: "Thanks. Enjoy your drink."]
$gaFC_KBAHeOrShe gives an ironic salute, and says "Look me up, captain. I'll be around if you want to do business." $gaFC_KBAHeOrShe turns away and sips $gaFC_KBAhisOrHer drink.

[Line 4732] [Option Selected: "I still need more on Coureuse. Can you help?"]
$gaFC_KBAHeOrShe sighs. "Maybe. Look, this is a business. It's ... I'll need something more if I'm going to tell you this. $gaFC_kapteynBarBribeCost credits."
$gaFC_KBAHeOrShe taps at $gaFC_KBAhisOrHer datapad and holds it out for you to confirm the transaction with your own.

[Line 4732] [Options Given: gaFC_kapteynBarOfferBribe:Pay the credits
gaFC_kapteynBarDone:"I'll figure it out myself. Enjoy your drink."]

[Line 4733] [Option Selected: Pay the credits]
"Now you didn't hear this from me - because I don't mess with Pathers. They're all crazy. Don't care about credits one bit. Or they do, demanding tithes for this or that infraction against their Ludd-bedamned rules, but I just can't get a read on 'em."
"There's a cell of them infiltrating Laicaille Habitat. Going after Coureuse, I gathered. Nothing else there worth the trouble."

[Line 4733] [Options Given: gaFC_kapteynBarOfferBribe2:"Do you have proof? Documentation?"]

[Line 4734] [Option Selected: "Do you have proof? Documentation?"]
"Um. Look." $gaFC_KBAHeOrShe goes into damage control mode, "Like I said, I don't mess with Pathers. I found their operation, but I didn't dig. I didn't charge you that much, see? You've got the bodyguards and heavily armed $shipOrFleet, I'm just some thawed-out space-meat trying to make a living."
$gaFC_KBAHeOrShe takes a deep breath, then says "Look, I'm sorry it's not better info. But I'm not going there. Maybe if you ask around you can get their attention - they have a goal, they won't just pop you in a corridor and attract unnecessary attention. Find out how they're communicating with home base, maybe. These Pathers, they're all recent. They've got to be coordinating with leadership somehow."
"Now please." $gaFC_KBAHeOrShe finishes the drink in one big gulp, "Good-bye and good luck." $gaFC_KBAHeOrShe stands, and makes for an exit.

"Written orders." $HeOrShe swipes with $hisOrHer hand to underline the point. "No exceptions. I told you people this before. If anything goes wrong during intra-station transport of Ludd-knows-what you people are stowing away in your secret warehouse, it'll be my head in the airlock."

As you upload salvage logs, you explain to Archon $personLastName that you discovered a secret hypercommunication relay in the derelict Groombridge Habitat that's been sending periodic transmissions to a repeater close to Laicaille Habitat. And it, in turn, has been receiving transmissions from an array of probes around a distant star. And this array was compromised by a scavenger on the far end, and...
The archon goes pale, "-so pirates, or even Pathers, could be..."
You nod.
The archon shakes $hisOrHer head, "They said there'd be no wild experiments! Everyone remembers Galatia."

[Line 4797] As you upload sensor readings and the scans recorded by rad-hardened drones, you explain to Archon $personLastName that you discovered a secret hypercommunication relay in the derelict Groombridge Habitat and it's been sending periodic transmissions to a repeater close to Laicaille Habitat. Someone has been talking without using official channels...
The archon goes pale, "I was told that, that it'd all be above-board. If they're keeping secrets from me, there's no telling what they could be doing..."
You nod.
The archon looks grim. "They said there'd be no wild experiments! Everyone remembers Galatia."

[Line 4797] [Options Given: gaFCArchonPL_conclude1:Continue]

[Line 4798] [Option Selected: Tell the archon how easily you discovered information on the intel operation on Laicaille]
You explain to Archon $personLastName that you have full documentation of the org chart, budget, and watch schedule of a League Fleet intel operation on Laicaille. There's even a line-item for a safehouse, and it aligns suspiciously with the cessation of a Fleet Intel search for Scylla Coureuse.
You forward the documents you received to drive the point home that you got everything on this sloppy operation by throwing a few credits around in-system. You hint at what a Pather cell could do with this information; the Persean League doesn't seem to be taking Laicaille Habitat's security very seriously.
The archon clenches $hisOrHer jaw. "I was given assurances..."

[Line 4799] [Option Selected: Tell the archon about the 'comm intercepts' to Laicaille from a 'radical agitator' on Fikenhild]
You explain that you have a communication intercept sent by Cavin Pharoh - a dangerous radical agitator on Fikenhild - to Scylla Coureuse. On Laicaille.
If Fleet Intel knows about this, then what's their game? And if Fleet Intel doesn't know about this, then that's even worse, isn't it?
The archon looks grim at this prospect.
As you forward the fake intercept, the archon finally finds $hisOrHer words. "They told me everyone would be quiet, no trouble, no games..."

[Line 4799] [Options Given: gaFCArchonPL_conclude1:Continue]

[Line 4800] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Laicaille is free and proud! And by the stars, that means something to the so-called 'minor' polities of the Persean League," $heOrShe nods significantly to you. "-even if Gens Hannan doesn't respect it."
"They say 'don't ask questions', they say 'League defense' and 'need to know' and 'we've got a handle on it'. It's been a mess from start. And Laicaille is to shoulder all the risk?"
Archon $personLastName takes several deep breaths, then meets your gaze.
"I've been letting those Kazeronian spies push me around. Push Laicaille around. Lord it over us with their 'security clearance' dross."

[Line 4801] [Option Selected: Continue]
The archon's voice steadies with a cold rage that's been building for many cycles. "We're better than that. We'll show them who Laicaille really belongs to - not a bunch of Kazeron gens babies tracking dirt onto our fine station."

[Line 4803] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for Scylla Coureuse."]
"Oh?" The archon's eyes flick off to one side then back to you.
"I don't think I've heard of her," $heOrShe says, asserting a placid tone of bureaucratic impatience. "You know there's a public comm directory for this sort of thing, captain."

[Line 4804] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for Scylla Coureuse."]
"This again." The archon's eyes flick off to one side then back to you.
"Like I told you before, there's a public comm directory. This is outside the purview of my office."

"Um. Yes, actually. Recent events in the Galatia system, right? Dangerous what the Academy got up to, and while they deserve reprimand, the Hegemony reacted with typical overreach." A note of indignation enters $hisOrHer speech.
"The Persean League filed a complaint in the Interfactional Dispute Council, did you hear? We don't expect much to come of it, but someone has to say something, right?"
The archon examines you for a moment then says "Why do you ask?"

[Line 4806] [Options Given: gaFC_archonAskCoureuse:"I'm looking for Scylla Coureuse. She was involved."
gaFC_archonAskGalatia2:"Do you think something like that could happen here?"

[Line 4807] [Option Selected: "Do you think something like that could happen here?"]
"Of course not," $heOrShe says curtly, "I'm kept informed of all major industrial and research projects in this system. And the pirates, " the last word spoken with a tone of some annoyance, "They aren't capable of anything truly catastrophic. Unless another warlord shows up, but that's why we pay our share to the Persean League Armamentarium."
The archon sits up straighter, "So I assure you captain, you have nothing to worry about while doing business on Laicaille Habitat."

[Line 4808] [Options Given: gaFC_archonConfront:"I have proof that Scylla Coureuse is on this station."]

$HeOrShe is looking nervous. "I don't know what you're talking about, captain. Without some kind of evidence of...  Um. Look, I have another appointment. Good day, captain."
The archon hits a button and dumps you back to a holding pattern bearing the spinning crest of Laicaille Habitat's executive council.
The archon is hiding something, but you won't get it out of $himOrHer without some kind of compelling evidence.

[Line 4812] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 4813] [Option Selected: "I have proof that Scylla Coureuse is on this station."]
The archon freezes up, stammering "I'm uh, of course I- "

[Line 4814] Now is the time to drive it home. What inconvenient truth will you reveal to the archon?

[Line 4815] With only one piece of evidence to support your claim, it would be premature to make your revelation. You need to make sure that the archon cannot deny your accusation by finding another piece of evidence.

[Line 4821] [Option Selected: Tell the Archon about the Pather cell operating here]
You explain to Archon $personLastName that you intercepted comm logs that reveal that a cell of Pather terrorists has infiltrated Laicaille Habitat under false identities to track down Scylla Coureuse. They know about the League intelligence safehouse and they have requested reinforcements to finish the job.
As the archon reads your uploaded log analysis, $heOrShe pales and stares wide-eyed at your revelation. "We're just a small polity. Siyavong told me no one would ever know. And now there are Pathers crawling in the Ludd-cursed walls?"

[Line 4822] [Option Selected: Tell the Archon about the secret hypercomms relay on Groombridge station]
As you upload salvage logs, you explain to Archon $personLastName what they show - that you discovered a secret hypercommunication relay in the derelict Groombridge Habitat that's been sending periodic transmissions to a repeater close to Laicaille Habitat.

[Line 4827] [Option Selected: "Orders from Kazeron? I can see who really runs Laicaille."]
"It's not like that at all," the archon sputters. "Laicaille is free and proud! Small, yes, but strategically important. And not tied up in the nepotistic gens politics of Kazeron." $HisOrHer face starts turning red, "They don't understand! Out here we have to work for a living. We face risks those fools can't imagine. What kind of deal is this 'league' if they won't wipe out that pack of pirates holed up in Kapteyn that've been hounding us for... for cycles! And the fleet taxes!" 
Archon $personLastName closes $hisOrHer eyes and takes several deep breaths, then meets your gaze with a new determination.
"You know what. You're right."

[Line 4827] [Options Given: gaFC_archonLetMeSeeHerGoad2:"I am?"]

[Line 4828] [Option Selected: "I am?"]
The archon's voice steadies with a cold rage that's been building for many cycles, it seems. "It's time to show them who Laicaille belongs to- and it's not a bunch of Kazeron gens-babies tracking dirt onto our fine station."

[Line 4829] [Option Selected: "She is a free citizen of the League. Does that mean nothing?"]
"Look, we value our freedom here as much as- no, we value it more than those tin-pot plutocrats from Kazeron," the archon sputters. "Laicaille is free and proud! And by the stars, that means something here, even if you don't see it, and-" $HisOrHer face starts turning red, "they say 'don't ask questions', they say 'League defense' and 'need to know' and 'we've got a handle on it'. Do they? With this whole mess set to explode?"
Archon $personLastName closes $hisOrHer eyes and takes several deep breaths, then meets your gaze and says, "You're right. I've been letting those Kazeronian spies push me around. Push Laicaille around. Lord it over us with their 'security clearance' dross. I've... let down what it means to be Laicaillian."

[Line 4831] [Option Selected: "Fair enough. Sorry for prying."]
"Wait," says the archon, still upset, "You're just going to drop the matter? No, I don't believe it. What's your angle, $playerName? Who are you working for? Westernesse media, one of those stupid holovid programs? Or is this another Kazeron psy-op, playing with those back-water rubes from Laicaille?" $HeOrShe takes a couple deep breaths and steadies $himOrHerself.
"Alright Captain $playerName, if that's really who you are. It's not 'fair enough' that I'm willing to cover for some game those upstart Kazeron spies want to play. There's nothing fair about it, nothing fair about how we've been pushed around and manipulated. Laicaille Habitat is free and proud!

gaFC generic Comm relay hack
------------------------------
[Line 4836] You could run a snoop algorithm through the message cache to find "Scylla Coureuse" and related keywords. Only recent messages and unencrypted stores will be accessible, but there may be useful intel, and the process is nondestructive.

[Line 4836] [Options Given: 1:gaFC_installHack:Install and run the snoop algorithm]

[Line 4837] Your $shipOrFleet was recently detected - or is currently being tracked by - a nearby fleet, making a covert hack impossible.

[Line 4837] [Options Given: defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 4838] [Option Selected: Install and run the snoop algorithm]
A two-spacer team rides a work drone to the relay and makes a quick hull cut to access a hard data connection. Within a minute, the snoop algorithm is set loose, the hull re-sealed, and the ops team returns.
Now you wait for it to do its work.

[Line 4838] [Options Given: gaFC_installHack1:Continue]

[Line 4839] [Option Selected: Continue]
After a tense hour or so, your comms officer informs you that the snoop is complete. A team of officers and specialists proficient in techops, infosec, and comms has been analyzing the snoop's data as it has come in, and have already prepared a preliminary report.
"The team is still finishing the detailed analysis and decrypting what we can," your comms officer reports, "But we've got a pretty good idea of the big picture."

[Line 4839] [Options Given: gaFC_installHack2:"Which is?"]

[Line 4840] [Option Selected: "Which is?"]
"It looks like most major factions and a few freelancers and underworld agents have been showing an anomalous level of activity in the Isirah system. There are plausible explanations for this of course, but what tipped us off was some sloppy infosec by a Pather infiltrator."
Here, your comms officer pulls up a communication ID and a League ID summary.

[Line 4840] [Options Given: gaFC_installHack3:"Who am I looking at?"]

[Line 4841] [Option Selected: "Who am I looking at?"]
"Jensen Gallegos. All the signs of a Pather infiltrator. The ID doesn't hold up to scrutiny as you can see... er, yes captain. The big picture," they flip through some irrelevant data logs then focus again on a series of messages sent as text, "They slipped up here, mentioning Coureuse by name, though misspelled. That led us to discover a simple code system used by what appears to be a cell of Pathers operating on Laicaille Habitat."
The League ID of not-Jensen Gallegos is joined by a handful more IDs with annotated discrepancies and errors.

[Line 4841] [Options Given: gaFC_installHack4:Continue]

[Line 4842] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Lots of communication, both text and holo. They think Coureuse is on Laicaille Habitat, but they can't get close to her, and they don't think their identities will hold up to a security check. Which is correct," your comms officer says with a touch of pride. "It sounds like they're asking home base to call in some big guns, whatever that might be. Or whoever."
The full report will be completed within the shift, but you know what you need to know: Laicaille Habitat.

------------------------------
[Line 4845] [Options Given: 1:gaFC_visitLaicailleSafehouse:Meet the Archon and visit the safehouse of Scylla Coureuse]

[Line 4847] You step off your shuttle to meet the grim-faced Archon $personLastName and $hisOrHer entourage. You are introduced to the other six members of the Laicaille Executive Council; the archon assures you of their full support, though a surreptitious eye roll by one of the council members in the back suggests that the archon's enthusiasm is not shared by all.

[Line 4848] The archon's eyes find the package of krill paste tucked under one of your arms ('Sub-Kay brand, blue-bar special). $HeOrShe raises an eyebrow but makes no comment.

[Line 4850] Archon $personLastName speaks a quiet word into $hisOrHer commband and a small squad of diversely equipped Laicaille militia appears. 
"Captain, let's go see that safehouse," $heOrShe says, and turns to lead your party toward a station transport shaft.

[Line 4850] [Options Given: gaFC_laicailleVisit2:Follow the archon]

[Line 4851] [Option Selected: Follow the archon]
The safehouse is a low-rent commercial warehouse in a medium-security volume of this station ring. The thin bulkheads leave you just within earshot of the thudding bass of the twilit entertainment concourse a couple sections over. 
As a score of officials and station militia approach the entrance of the safehouse - a standard cargo lock - a trio of lounging League agents leap to their feet.

[Line 4851] [Options Given: gaFC_laicailleVisit3:Watch what happens]

[Line 4852] [Option Selected: Watch what happens]
The station archon strides forward, and channeling the resentment you stoked, harangues the League agents for endangering the station, stomping on the rights of League citizenry, and above all gross incompetence. 
The young Kazeronian agent in command wipes a drop of sweat from their forehead, "Archon, we've got this. League security demands-"
"No, you don't got this. This operation is riddled with leaks," the archon glances briefly at you, "And your meltdown of an operation is a direct threat to our security. Laicaille Habitat is exerting its sovereign rights in this matter as of now, with the full support of the executive council."

[Line 4853] [Option Selected: Continue]
The League agent lowers their wavering pistol, and at that, the flanking agents lose the strength of their composure. 
The archon takes the agent's pistol, checks the safety, then shoves the agent away, leading you to the airlock. The control panel gives way to executive override codes, and the archon motions for you to pass through the armored doorway.

[Line 4853] [Options Given: gaFC_laicailleVisit4b:Enter the airlock]

[Line 4854] [Option Selected: Enter the airlock]
A woman stands before you, holding a datapad, looking quizzically at the newcomers.
You look around the dark space, taking in the shadowy equipment racks, humming machines, and cargo crates. A small zero-G style hab pod in the corner must be her domestic space.

[Line 4854] [Options Given: gaFC_laicailleVisit5:"Scylla Coureuse, I presume."]

[Line 4855] [Option Selected: "Scylla Coureuse, I presume."]
"Yes. That's me," she says cautiously. "And... Archon $personLastName. This is unexpected. To what do I owe the honor?"
The archon nods toward you, "Captain $playerName. Who has a way of poking around in other people's business. Now it's your turn."

[Line 4856] Coureuse spots the package of krill paste under your arm. "Is that... Sub-Kay blue-bar? Where- how did you-"

[Line 4856] [Options Given: gaFC_laicailleVisit5Alamang2:"A gift from Elissa."]

[Line 4857] [Option Selected: "A gift from Elissa."]
Coureuse breaks into a smile of genuine joy.
"Of course! We always talked about how bad it smelled, but nothing is as good." She takes it, almost caressing the plastic while lost in some memory. She returns to herself with a start, "Oh, I'm sorry, just. Old times." She puts the package on a workbench, "Please, explain. Why are you here?"

[Line 4857] [Options Given: gaFC_laicailleVisit6:"I have a message for you."]

[Line 4858] [Options Given: gaFC_laicailleVisit6:"I have a message for you."]

[Line 4859] [Option Selected: "I have a message for you."]
Archon $personLastName eyes you, a nonverbal inquiry about whether $heOrShe is intruding, and concludes that $heOrShe is.
"I'll let you two speak privately. Citizen Coureuse, I am informing you that you are now under the direct protection of the Laicaille Executive Council. We shall ensure your safety on this station, and," $heOrShe casts a glance back at the League agents, "And ensure your right to freedom of movement as per the Persean League Charter." 
As if just remembering its existence, the archon slips the League agent's pistol into $hisOrHer belt, nods, and steps toward the ongoing shouting match back in the airlock.  
"Baird wants me back, doesn't she." Coureuse crosses her arms.

[Line 4859] [Options Given: gaFC_laicailleVisit7:Give her Baird's message on your datapad]

[Line 4860] [Option Selected: Give her Baird's message on your datapad]
You pass the datapad to Coureuse, and she takes it to a chair set at a workstation a few meters away, activating a privacy field that dulls the sound and blurs her image.

[Line 4860] [Options Given: gaFC_laicailleVisit8:Wait
gaFC_laicailleVisit8b:Look around]

[Line 4861] [Option Selected: Wait]
You hear muffled speech, Baird's tone is unmistakable. The indistinct outline of Coureuse is still, listening. Then, when Baird's speech ends, it slumps in the chair as if all will had been drained away.

[Line 4862] [Option Selected: Look around]
You turn to examine the workshop: racks of sub-AI processing cores sleep in coolant cradles, festooned with wires. An agrav-equipped overhead winch holds a machine casing in safety locks above a macroassembler with its modular components exposed. The workbench nearby holds several multipurpose engineering arms hovering over some device, its innards arranged like an exploded engineering diagram.

[Line 4863] Option(s) Selected: ['gaFC_laicailleVisit8'];['gaFC_laicailleVisit8b']
A couple minutes later, the privacy field collapses and Coureuse emerges. She looks tired.
She hands the datapad back to you, and says "I'll come with you."

gaFC_laicailleVisit10:"What did Baird say?"

[Line 4865] [Option Selected: "Well. Let's go, then."]
"Okay. But I need-" Coureuse looks over her workbenches, computing array, and projects in various states of completion, "My, um, things."
You inform her that you have a special team that's well practiced in moving delicate scientific equipment. In fact, you'll introduce her to your ops chief to make arrangements right now...

gaFC Scylla Coureuse back to Galatia Academy
------------------------------
[Line 4869] Your $shipOrFleet is interrupted in the middle of a standard approach sequence; instead of the usual traffic control chatter, your flagship receives a comm request directly from the office of the Provost. 
"Captain," reports your comms officer, "She wants to speak with you."

[Line 4869] [Options Given: gaFC_return1:Open a channel]

[Line 4870] [Option Selected: Open a channel]
The image of Provost Anahita Baird appears.
"Captain, it is good to see you return, finally. Bring her by shuttle," she says, "Directly to this docking port," a chime signals the receipt of navigation instructions and docking codes. "I'll meet you there." 
The comm line shuts off.

[Line 4870] [Options Given: gaFC_return2:Continue]

[Line 4871] [Option Selected: Continue]
You step off the shuttle, thrusters clicking as they cool, followed by Scylla Coureuse. The scientist was quiet on the brief shuttle ride which has returned her to Galatia Academy Station after her time in hiding.
As promised, Provost Baird is waiting with a small group of masked guards and senior advisors. Academician Sebestyen waves as your gaze drifts over him.
"It is so good to have you back with us, Scylla," says Baird.

Sebestyen smiles widely as you wave back. Baird is intent on Coureuse, and makes no acknowledgement.

[Line 4873] [Option Selected: Pretend you didn't see]
Coureuse nods to Baird's words, though occupies herself with examining the reception lounge. "It hasn't changed much," she says.
Something in this doesn't please the provost, you think. 
"Well," says Baird, "I believe you'll find that quite a lot has changed. Academician Alviss Sebestyen, please come forward- thank you. I understand that you knew Scylla back- " at his vigorous nod, she says "Yes, of course."

[Line 4873] [Options Given: gaFC_return4:Continue]

[Line 4874] [Option Selected: Continue]
Sebestyen begins to welcome Coureuse, shaking her hand, and asking about her trip. Coureuse raises an eyebrow at the question, and Baird interrupts, "There will be time for that later, Alviss. Please show the newly reinstated Academician Coureuse to her quarters - then show her the new laboratory." 
Baird pauses, seeming to examine Coureuse for a response, but Scylla simply bows her head slightly in acknowledgement without meeting Baird's eyes.
"Scylla, I hope you can thrive here. Again. Please go with Alviss. And... keep an open mind," Baird says.

[Line 4874] [Options Given: gaFC_return5:Continue]

[Line 4875] [Option Selected: Continue]
With a sigh, Baird turns from them to you.
"Captain. Thank you for finding her and bringing her home," the provost watches the two leave the receiving lounge, starting to chat, Coureuse finally starting to smile. "With Scylla, we can begin it all again." 
Baird holds up a hand to indicate an adjoining transport pod, "Let us remove to a more suitable setting for the continuation of our discussion."

[Line 4875] [Options Given: gaFC_return6:Board the transport pod]

[Line 4876] [Option Selected: Board the transport pod]
Baird seems to study the passing conduits and vistas visible through the pod's bay windows, lost in thought. The silence grows, and you find that this may be an opportunity to ask something of the provost without interrupting one of her lectures.

[Line 4878] [Options Given: gaFC_returnHubLeague:"I don't think the Persean League will be happy to lose Coureuse."]

[Line 4879] [Options Given: gaFC_returnHubScylla:"She doesn't like you, does she."]

[Line 4880] [Options Given: gaFC_returnHubNothing:Say nothing]

[Line 4881] [Option Selected: "I don't think the Persean League will be happy to lose Coureuse."]
"Some among their ranks, yes," a hint of smile forms on Baird's face, "But others can see that this is the best way forward. The League can't pull the best and brightest from the entire Sector. The Galatia Academy can. They don't have the theoretical research and experimentation infrastructure we do. It's all practical matters with their Fleet Armamentarium; weapons, warships, heavy industry, and doling out contracts to gens-allies."
"Furthermore, subfactions within the League could not call an open vote on a matter so delicate as this. We merely resolved their political questions by other means," the provost tips her head toward you, acknowledging your role.

[Line 4882] [Option Selected: "She doesn't like you, does she."]
Baird looks at you for a long moment. You think you see something new. Something almost like emotional pain.
"Scylla never appreciated the gifts I... the academy offered her. It's how she was raised, perhaps. Her insubordination was indulged. Became habitual. But with time, when she sees what we accomplish, maybe her higher sense of rationality will win out. I know she is capable of it."
Baird turns, staring forward, and sets her jaw.

[Line 4883] [Option Selected: Say nothing]
Through the silence, you can almost hear Baird thinking.
The transport pod hisses to a halt, and you feel the subtle shift of agrav fields. You step off and note that this seems to be a back entrance which allows Baird to avoid the waiting room full of important people unused to being told to wait.

[Line 4884] [Option Selected: Continue]
You follow Provost Baird into her office, and the doors close with a notable absence of sound. She motions you to a seat in front of her desk.
"First," she says, "you ought to be compensated for your fine work recovering a valuable asset."
Baird unlocks her desk interface and enters some commands; your personal datapad pings in response.

[Line 4884] [Options Given: gaFC_returnToAcademy7a2:Continue]

[Line 4885] [Option Selected: Continue]
Baird taps at her interface, her face illuminated by a moving image. "She seems to be settling in," she says, watching.
A holo projects into the space above her desk: a surveillance feed of a gleaming new physics laboratory. Scylla Coureuse is being introduced by Sebestyen to various academicians, judging by their formal dress, and technicians in various states of protective garb. They look young and eager to begin work.

[Line 4885] [Options Given: gaFC_return8a:Continue]

[Line 4886] [Option Selected: Continue]
She motions at the image, "We'll rebuild what we can from Coureuse's independent work and what she can recall, but without the Kallichore Archive, it would be... inconvenient to recapture certain data sets."
Baird looks up, at the proverbial sky, "I expect that the Hegemony Ministry of Technology Standards has installed very particular forms of surveillance in place around the Galatia system to avoid being caught flat-footed by another 'little accident'. We dare not interfere directly, lest we give them another excuse to meddle."

[Line 4886] [Options Given: gaFC_return9a:Continue]

[Line 4887] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Acquire the Kallichore Archive, captain," Baird says, "And quickly." She turns away, dismissing you. "It would be premature to speak too much about what I am building toward, but a magnificent breakthrough is growing closer."
You feel the doors open soundlessly behind you, and the mirror-masked guards presence like a slight rise in ambient static electricity. Time to go.

[Line 4889] [Option Selected: Continue]
As you enter Baird's office, you notice that Gargoyle is in the sitting area, heels resting on the common table. The hacker casually closes a holodisplay, "Oh, so good of everyone to join me. I was getting awfully bored, I thought I might read some files, but you got here just as I was getting started..."
Although she shows no outward change in expression, you get the familiar feeling of potent apprehension and clarity which fills your gut when a high-powered starship weapon is armed to fire. Provost Baird speaks with firm authority, "An amusing prank, I'm sure. Now remove your feet from there before I have you removed from my office again."
"Yes'm," Gargoyle mutters sullenly, dropping boots to the floor.

[Line 4889] [Options Given: gaFC_returnToAcademy7b2:Continue]

[Line 4890] [Option Selected: Continue]
Provost Baird moves behind her desk, brushes the surface with a scowl, then taps a few keys.
"First, captain," she says, "you ought to be compensated for your fine work recovering a valuable asset."
Your personal datapad pings in response to a command she entered into her desk interface.
Gargoyle perks up and withdraws a highly modified datapad, trailing loose cables. After a moment it also pings, to which Gargoyle says "Mm, Anahita. Don't spoil the good captain."

[Line 4890] [Options Given: gaFC_returnToAcademy8b:Continue
gaFC_returnToAcademy8b2:"Are you... watching my accounts?"]

[Line 4891] [Option Selected: "Are you... watching my accounts?"]
Gargoyle gives you a guilty look, slowly stowing the datapad.
"Don't even start," Baird snaps. "Fight about it after this meeting." She gives her head a shake and returns her attention to the desk interface.

[Line 4891] [Options Given: gaFC_returnToAcademy8b:Continue]

[Line 4892] [Option Selected: Continue]
A holoprojected image blooms into the space above Baird's desk: a surveillance feed of a gleaming new physics laboratory. Coureuse is being introduced by Sebestyen to various academicians, judging by their formal dress, and technicians in various states of protective garb. They look young and eager to begin work.
"She seems to be settling in," Baird says, motioning at the display, "Sebestyen is more capable than he appears. He has been both persistent and meticulous in facilitating the rebirth of this research team."
Gargoyle speaks up, "And just look what happens when he's not keeping an eye on me. All sorts of trouble!"

[Line 4892] [Options Given: gaFC_returnToAcademy9b:Continue]

[Line 4893] [Option Selected: Continue]
Bairds nods in acknowledgement, then says "My team has been working on the Kallichore data, decrypted thanks to Gargoyle's hard work, I must admit." You see Gargoyle take a small bow, as if having completed a masterful performance.
"Though we've started reopening previous avenues of research," she says, "having Coureuse here to form the heart of the advanced theory team will result in tremendous progress after Kallichore's bungling. This is her life's work, after all."

[Line 4893] [Options Given: gaFC_returnToAcademy10b:Continue]

[Line 4894] [Option Selected: Continue]
"And," Gargoyle interrupts, "I cracked those Hegemony snooper sats. All reports will be green across the board, no suspicious hyperspace folding going on here, officer!" 
Baird nods in acknowledgement again, "Indeed. Gargoyle has been very useful." She turns to you, "And you as well. I anticipate that you will be instrumental in carrying out these experiments to their full effect, as I expect that some will entail... dramatic results."

[Line 4894] [Options Given: gaFC_returnToAcademy11b:Continue]

[Line 4895] [Option Selected: Continue]
Provost Baird pauses and turns to you, examining your reaction. "You must be wondering what this is all for, captain."

[Line 4895] [Options Given: gaFC_return11b1:"Yes."
gaFC_return11b2:"Not really. The pay is good."
gaFC_return11b3:"You're obviously trying to re-open the Gates."
gaFC_return11b4:Say nothing. You won't fall for this again.]

[Line 4896] [Option Selected: "Yes."]
She proceeds without regard for your response, "This is about opening up the galaxy again, captain. Yes, you see it now: the Gates. It was always about the Gates."

[Line 4897] [Option Selected: "Not really. The pay is good."]
She proceeds without regard for your response, "This is about opening up the galaxy again, captain. Yes, you see it now: the Gates. It was always about the Gates."

[Line 4898] [Option Selected: "You're obviously trying to re-open the Gates."]
Almost unconsciously she shoots a look at you, a flash of anger for ruining her moment, before she catches herself. "Yes, captain. And more- this is about opening up the galaxy again. Everything I have done, everything I have worked for has always been about the Gates."

[Line 4899] [Option Selected: Say nothing. You won't fall for this again.]
She proceeds without regard for your response, "This is about opening up the galaxy again, captain. Yes, you see it now: the Gates. It was always about the Gates."

[Line 4900] Option(s) Selected: ['gaFC_return11b1'];['gaFC_return11b2'];['gaFC_return11b4']
Gargoyle makes a tiny applause at this revelation, somewhat undermining the gravity of Baird's speech.
Baird ignores this, taps a datapad, and the holoprojector flickers a 3D hyphae map into existence. You recognize the image: a map of the Domain-era gate network within the Persean Sector. A dense spot in one prominent lobe contains what you know as the Core Worlds.
"Or, more precisely, what the Gates can do," Baird says.

[Line 4900] [Options Given: gaFC_return13b:Continue]

[Line 4901] [Option Selected: Continue]
Gargoyle speaks up again, more earnest somehow than usual "Freedom! Imagine that, $playerFirstName. The technology the Domain used to enslave humanity - liberated! The small minds that rule us, they're all still shackled by Domain-mindset. All alike in their own way, Tri-Tach, Ludders, the Hegemony; soulless minions of orthodoxy, all of them!"
"Imagine if we took that all away from them, imagine if anyone could go anywhere and do anything!" Gargoyle cackles, rocking back and forth.

[Line 4901] [Options Given: gaFC_return14b:Continue]

[Line 4902] [Option Selected: Continue]
You notice that Baird has watched Gargoyle without emotion through this speech. As Gargoyle settles down, becoming distracted by a datapad, the provost speaks to you in a tone of commanding finality, "Return in a week or so, captain. My people need time to work. And you've earned a break."
"But keep your head down. The factions are restless after what you pulled in Isirah."
Baird turns to her desk console, expressions moving across her face as she appears to skim messages. "That is all, captain."
"And Gargoyle," she says after a moment.

[Line 4902] [Options Given: gaFC_return15b:"I want to talk about your intentions with this technology."
gaFC_returnLeave:Leave]

[Line 4903] [Option Selected: "I want to talk about your intentions with this technology."]
Baird turns from her desk display and looks through you, "There is no 'technology', captain. Merely possibilities. And vast though those possibilities may appear, they are yet mere possibilities."
She turns away again, dismissing you. "We shall speak of this later."
You feel the doors open soundlessly behind you, and the mirror-masked guards presence like a slight rise in static electricity. Time to go. Gargoyle joins you on the way out, giving you a sympathetic look while muttering something.

"I don't hold anything against you, captain. They won," $heOrShe says, then shakes $hisOrHer head. "Laicaille Habitat is small and poor in the grand scheme of the Persean League. Despite what the charter says, that's all there is to it."

$HeOrShe pauses, then shrugs. "Reynard Hannan. He didn't like the way things went. Made him look bad. He turned our executive council against me. Wasn't hard for him. Gens Hannan is behind most of the out-of-system investment, to say nothing of control over Fleet patrols. And that was it."
"I don't hold anything against you, demarchon. They won," $heOrShe says, then shakes $hisOrHer head. "Laicaille Habitat is small and poor in the grand scheme of the Persean League. Despite what the charter says, that's all there is to it."

"That would be Gens Hannan you recognize, $playerSirOrMadam"

"They were replaced," $heOrShe says imperiously. "I, of course, have only recently been burdened with this office."
"You see, the local rabble couldn't maintain order and my family, Gens Hannan, has invested tremendously into the industries this backwater mining camp feeds. It was decided that someone responsible ought to look after things directly." $HeOrShe sighs, crossing $hisOrHer arms, "Lucky me."

"I shall do my time, as the gens demands, and then it is agreed that I shall take up a more fitting office. Perhaps as vice-minister of something or other. A navarchship perhaps?" $HeOrShe smiles, "That would only be the beginning, of course.

Academician Sebestyen appears, fidgeting, in your display.
"Captain! Hello, how are you?" he says, then stammers "I mean, I'm sorry, I'm supposed to tell you- ask you. Provost Baird would like to meet with you concerning a very important development. If you would please come meet her as soon as, um, at your convenience, that'd be wonderful." He pauses for a breath. "That's it. I'm sure we'll see you soon. Thank you. Bye?"
You manage to close the comms link with unusually little small-talk from Sebestyen.

"Oh?" The junior academy agent raises their eyebrows at you, making a show of believing your statement while checking their datapad. 
"Oh." You see the truth register on their face, "Oh! Yes. Immediately. Please $playerSirOrMadam, if you would be so kind as to come with me right away, we'll get you to your meeting with Provost Baird."

[Line 4931] [Options Given: gaPZ_introCont4:Continue]

[Line 4932] [Option Selected: Continue]
You enter the provost's office once again. Baird's desk is messier than usual, covered in memory cores, interfacing devices, and an anonymous matte-gray case.
"Good. Now that you're here, I believe Gargoyle should be joining us via comms-" Baird's eyes flick, annoyed, to a portable holocomms unit on her desk where an image of the hacker's head is intently paying attention to something else.

[Line 4932] [Options Given: gaPZ_introCont5:Continue]

[Line 4933] [Option Selected: Continue]
Baird turns fully toward you and begins her speech. "Having examined the decrypted Kallichore Archive-" this catches Gargoyle's attention "-we now have hard leads on a certain collaboration my predecessor carried out with senior executives of the Tri-Tachyon corporation."
"Tri-Tachyon pursued research forbidden by the Hegemony at a location outside the core worlds referred to only by the code-name 'Alpha Site'. The archived communications have been algorithmically stripped of contextual descriptions. However." Baird pauses, seeming to relish the moment of knowing something that you do not.

[Line 4933] [Options Given: gaPZ_introCont6a:Wait it out
gaPZ_introCont6b:"However?"]

[Line 4935] [Option Selected: "However?";['gaPZ_introCont6a']]
"There are many signs that an individual with the surname 'Astraia' is involved. Who we are almost certain is-"
Gargoyle interrupts, "-Kelise Astraia, former weapons engineer employed at the Culann Starforge in the Hybrasil system by Tri-Tach. And rather underpaid in light of how essential the suits seem to have thought she was to the project."
Baird sets her jaw, "Thank you, Gargoyle," she says. "Kindly elaborate for the captain here."
The hacker grins, "Love to! So TT 'fired' Kelise over some incident, but if you look at her credit records... " A couple taps and the display fills with tables and numbers, "There are recurring payments, we're talking massive credits, something to do with 'Project Ziggurat', whatever that is. It sure makes up for her low salary at Culann, and... "

[Line 4935] [Options Given: gaPZ_introCont7:Continue]

[Line 4936] [Option Selected: Continue]
Using one hand to slide the volume control of the holocomm unit down low, Baird keeps her gaze on you.
"We think Kelise Astraia was promoted to this 'Alpha Site'," she says. "Obviously there are others involved, but she's a senior ordnance engineer that's clearly connected to the project. And her infosec practices were sloppy."
"I want to know what Tri-Tachyon was doing at this Alpha Site. Our best lead so far is Kelise Astraia. Go to Hybrasil and find out where she disappeared to. Someone must know where she's gone, or has some evidence of her intentions. Tri-Tachyon watches everyone; someone will be willing to sell you that information."

[Line 4937] [Option Selected: Continue]
Baird turns and stares through the shaded diamond-matrix windows overlooking the annexes and concourses of the Galatia Academy.

"For now," Baird says, "No."
"Coureuse's team is working on something else that came up in the Kallichore Archive but... " Baird, back still turned, rubs her spectacles thoughtfully. "It would be premature for you to speculate. I shall let you know when it can be put to use, captain."

[Line 4943] [Option Selected: "Do you have any idea what this research was for?"]
"I have a strong theory," says Provost Baird, "But I don't want to bias your investigation." 
She gives you a look over her shoulder, "Judging by the resources Tri-Tachyon put into this project, it will be either a groundbreaking discovery or a vast disappointment."

[Line 4944] [Option Selected: "Gargoyle, do you have more information?"]
The hacker appears to speak, but is muted. Gargoyle's head gives Baird an annoyed look.
"I'm sure you can contact Gargoyle on your own time, captain," she says without looking at you or at the holocomm display.

[Line 4945] [Option Selected: "I've got everything I need."]
"Then you should proceed, captain," says the provost.
You feel the doors open behind you, a guard waiting to escort you from the office.

"You asked! Oh, joy of joys." Gargoyle rocks back and forth, as if in the throes of ecstasy. "That's all it takes: asking nicely. You know, it's not everyone that can bring themselves to do that." 
Gargoyle smiles spitefully, then pauses, visibly calms down, and puts on a facade of professionalism. "It is an honor to assist you with this mission, captain. I will do my duty to my utmost."

[Line 4951] [Options Given: gaPZ_gargKelise1:"Good. So you can help?"]

The officer act is dropped as the hacker picks up a datapad, "This doesn't have to be difficult. It's Tri-Tach, they'll sell anything. Just ask my buddy Arroyo! He's a Tri-Tach goon top to bottom, he'll know who to bribe."
Gargoyle tosses the datapad onto the desk, looking satisfied. "Glad I could help, captain. I'm sure I'll prove essential to your success".

"The provost doesn't think it's important to let me explain," Gargoyle scoffs, "Maybe you should just fly off to Hybrasil without knowing anything but the name of one crackpot weapons engineer. No, go ahead! I'll wait. Tell me how it goes."
The silence draws out for nearly three seconds before Gargoyle begins ranting again.
"Imagine! Letting you con me into the data heist of a lifetime - set a nice fire under the High Hegemon's chair, didn't it! - then I decrypt the precious archive of the guy whose job she stole, and not asking what I thought of the contents? Which I read. Mostly. Can you believe it? Typical. She thinks she knows everything."

Gargoyle looks at you darkly, and says quietly, "You'll never be like Coureuse to her, you know. You're just muscle. A tool. A killer. Once you've served your purpose?"
Gargoyle turns away and flips a hand dismissively at you; the comms line goes black.

Tri-Tachyon thinks they're not supposed to be able to do that, but," a wobbly hand gesture, "Eh. Negotiable. Amazing what seemingly innocuous hardware can be made to do when you think outside the box."

"Is it you asking or Provost Baird?" he says in a tone that says he thinks it's Baird. "Doesn't matter," he slaps a hand on his desk and looks away, chewing on the problem.
"So. Tri-Tachyon employee huh? It's not terribly hard to pry data out of HR, to say nothing of franchise polity muni services. If you know who to ask, and how." He manages a half-smile, "And you're me," then turns back to face you.
"After taking some real heat from that last misbegotten crashdown of an operation you pulled, I'm going to need a little favor before I help you help Baird."

[Line 4965] [Options Given: gaPZ_arroyoAskKelise1:"What kind of favor?"]

[Line 4966] [Option Selected: "What kind of favor?"]
"It's a gift, is what it is," he says, "Dead easy. I just need someone else to do it. Here," Arroyo taps a key and a data transfer interface overlays your comm-view. He's sending an archive containing a series of comms recordings.
"This is a series of fake comms messages in which some leaky subcontractor proves that I was part of the conspiracy to hack the Hegemony relay in Aztlan. Take this to someone, I don't care who, someone semi-important in some pirate organization or other. Try Donn, or go to Qaras in the Yma system. Doesn't matter. Have them blackmail me with these messages."

[Line 4968] [Option Selected: "But you did take part in the conspiracy."]
"Yes, obviously," Arroyo rolls his eyes.

[Line 4969] [Option Selected: "Why are you leaking evidence against yourself?"]
"Vindication." Arroyo holds his hands palms up, eyebrows raised, waiting for you to understand his scheme. After a moment, he shakes his head and sighs.

[Line 4970] "Look- they're bad fakes. I spoofed a contract ID and bid low on this junk. Didn't even send the final payment. Hegemony spies and Tri-Tachyon Partner Relations are already sniffing after me so if it looks like a junior-exec smelled blood and was coming after my operation by manufacturing dirt, well, it raises some questions about the veracity of the entire accusation. Doesn't matter how flimsy; my PR team gets an angle to work. You see?"

[Line 4979] [Options Given: gaPZ_sellFakes:Offer to sell Arroyo's fake blackmail material]

[Line 4980] [Option Selected: Offer to sell Arroyo's fake blackmail material]
You pitch the material to the pirate- a series of recorded comm calls between Rayan Arroyo and various parties setting up and carrying out a job to hack the Aztlan Relay. The Hegemony would pay well for this, or someone well-positioned in Tri-Tachyon. Why not dream big, why not sell it to both?
As the pirate considers your offer and you can see the logic of the situation working across $hisOrHer face.
"I'm going to make you an offer," $heOrShe says, a menacing smile growing on $hisOrHer face. "Transmit everything you've got now or I have my gang blow you out of the sky."

[Line 4981] [Options Given: gaPZSellFakes1:"Brave words for someone without a warfleet behind them."]

[Line 4982] [Options Given: gaPZSellFakes2:"Oh no. Anything but that. Transmitting now."]

[Line 4983] [Options Given: gaPZSellFakes3:Insist on payment]

[Line 4984] [Option Selected: "Brave words for someone without a warfleet behind them."]
The pirate leans back and tries to give you a knowing smile, "I see this isn't your first time negotiating with an intelligent operator like myself. My um, threat was simply a ruse to see if you were serious."
"And um, you passed the test," $heOrShe says, leaning forward again. "I'm going to make you an offer and you're going to take it, because-"

[Line 4984] [Options Given: gaPZSellFakes1a:"You're going to pay me $gaPZ_paymentForCommFakes credits."]

[Line 4985] [Option Selected: "You're going to pay me $gaPZ_paymentForCommFakes credits."]
"I accept," $heOrShe says without hesitation, and wipes sweat from $hisOrHer brow, "Transferring credits now."

[Line 4985] [Options Given: gaPZSellFakes1b:"Transferring data now."]

[Line 4986] [Option Selected: "Transferring data now."]
With the data transfer complete, you watch as the pirate browses the blackmail material on $hisOrHer datapad with a hungry look on $hisOrHer face, "This is ... oh yes, very good. Wait 'til they see, it'll be-" $heOrShe seems to notice you again. "I believe we've made a fine deal, captain. Let's never speak of this again, yes?"
$personName shuts the commlink off, mercifully.

[Line 4986] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 4987] [Option Selected: "Oh no. Anything but that. Transmitting now."]
You transmit the data without bothering to put too much effort into acting scared; you have your dignity, after all.
As the transfer completes, the pirate leans back, a predatory smile on $hisOrHer face, "Very, very interesting. It's a good thing you came to someone smart, like me." 
"Now scram before I change my mind." 

[Line 4987] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Cut the comm link]

[Line 4988] [Option Selected: Insist on payment]
You pull out a personal datapad and explain that you can simply activate the EMP device attached to the memory core housing the blackmail data and they'll have no opportunity to blackmail anyone- in fact, you can spread word of their treachery in this matter. And then how many opportunities for mutual profit will show up in their orbit?
The pirate leans back and tries to give you a knowing smile, "Say no more. I can see that you are, like me, an intelligent operator. My um, threat was simply a ruse to see if you were serious about this business," $heOrShe says.

[Line 4988] [Options Given: gaPZSellFakes3a:Continue]

"And uh, congrats. You passed," $heOrShe says, recovering $hisOrHer composure. "You see before you someone who also knows all about business. And I'm going to make you an offer and you're going to take it, because- " 
The pirate rambles, explaining why you won't find anyone else willing or indeed able to put your offering to best use. It's not a very good pitch.

[Line 4989] [Options Given: gaPZSellFakes3b:Continue]

[Line 4990] [Option Selected: Continue]
You wait for the right moment then cut through the posturing like a sabot core through a fluxed shield envelope, arguing the pirate into a price of $gaPZ_paymentForCommFakesHigh credits for the fake blackmail material.
"By Ludd's commode, yes, I get it" $heOrShe says finally, wiping sweat from $hisOrHer brow, "I accept your price. Transferring credits."

returned to Arroyo after selling the fakes
------------------------------
[Line 4993] Arroyo seems genuinely amused when he answers the comms, "Ah, $playername! My ruthless blackmailer returns," he pauses for a moment and chuckles to himself while scrolling through a datapad.
"You should see the things they're saying about me, you'd think they caught me on holo in the High Hegemon's private quarters having a-" he looks up, "... Business, yes, of course." He tosses the datapad to the side. 
"You wanted the file on Kelise Astraia." He grins, "I didn't even have to bribe the admin at Culann Starforge for this. Would you believe that we worked together a few cycles ago? There's a story there, but let me tell you about your weapons engineer."

[Line 4993] [Options Given: gaPZ_returnArroyo1:Continue]

[Line 4994] [Option Selected: Continue]
Arroyo takes on the distant look of a cyberaug interfacing with the hypernet. With a nod, Arroyo summons a personnel file to overlay your comms-link, summarizing the life and career of Kelise Astraia.
"A bit of an eccentric, our Kelise," Arroyo says, "But you can get the details later. Relevant bit is here: looks here like she was contracting on the side for a Tri-Tach black project - one of them anyway - and was asked to go on-site full-time. Left a convincing resignation and booked a starship, the 'Hamatsu'. Venture-class. That one's made more than a few trips out of the core worlds; scavenging, special ops. A few jobs for the Company here and there."

[Line 4994] [Options Given: gaPZ_returnArroyo2:"Can you tell me more about the Hamatsu?"]

[Line 4995] [Option Selected: "Can you tell me more about the Hamatsu?"]
"Let's see. It looks like Astraia requested special modifications." Arroyo raises an eyebrow, "Expensive ones. I'm guessing some of this is a little extra to keep things quiet. No specs on these modifications, however. Lazy work by whoever was doing this data-gathering."
"Looks like the ship left the Hybrasil system and turned its transponder off sometime before jumping out. Doesn't necessarily mean anything, but... " Arroyo considers for a moment, then pages the file ahead. 

[Line 4995] [Options Given: gaPZ_returnArroyo3:"But what?"]

[Line 4996] [Option Selected: "But what?"]
"They didn't want to be followed," says Arroyo, looking somewhere off-comms, "I would assume the flight plan logged with the port authority is worthless. Someone has to know something though. Hmm." Data scrolls on his desk display.
"The Hamatsu is owned by one Callisto Ibrahim." he looks up at you, "Heard of her? No? Bit of a reputation. My former partner hired her once a while back. She lied up and down on her credentials," he shrugs. "But it worked out. Respect the con. Anyway, she's operating a few small fleets out of Agreus in the Arcadia system these days."
Arroyo's eye twitches in a certain way and the display records disappear.

[Line 4996] [Options Given: gaPZ_returnArroyo4:Continue]

[Line 4997] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Well, $playername, that was fun. I've forwarded the files. If I were you, I'd try to get some information out of Ibrahim. She seems like someone who knows how to do business if the pay is right."
Arroyo sits back, "Now I have a reputation to obscure, if you don't mind. Good luck finding your engineer. Remember: I don't want to hear any more about this. The last thing I need is to get some Company director on my case because you're stepping on their pet black project." 
With that, he terminates the link, leaving you with a spinning Tri-Tachyon logo.

[Line 5000] You buy drinks freely, targeting those patrons wearing the expensive professional clothing that serves as an unofficial uniform for junior Tri-Tachyon executives. Most attempt to 'network' with you, pitching unlikely business schemes as you nod and try to steer the conversation back toward a certain ordnance engineer.
Eventually you get a hit, of sorts.

"You're trying to poach talent aren't you," a smile and a wink from the smarmy suit, "You with one of the big Kazeron gens? Don't have to tell me. Anyway, it's easy - you just need credits. Talk to the administrator at Culann Starforge, show them you're serious. Everyone has an angle."
"Now, like I was saying, my product will completely redefine the paradigm, max-sizing next generation innovation..." 
You pretend to receive an urgent notice on your datapad, finish your drink, and escape.

talking to Culann admin; notably: does *not* require bar event to have been done
------------------------------
[Line 5003] The Tri-Tachyon comms logo resolves rapidly to the smiling administrator of Culann Starforge.
"Greetings Captain $playerName!" $HeOrShe glances at a secondary display, "Your net worth is admirable. On behalf of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, I would like to welcome you to Culann Starforge."
$HisOrHer perfect smile grows slightly larger. "We supply a variety of alloys to both private firms and major polities. Or perhaps you're a supplier in the ore trade?"

[Line 5003] [Options Given: gaPZ_adminAstraia1:Ask about Kelise Astraia
cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5004] [Option Selected: Ask about Kelise Astraia]
You inquire about Kelise Astraia. The administrator's smile glows slightly less wide and a touch of confusion grows on $hisOrHer face. "A former employee you say? Well, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation has top-line privacy guidelines when it comes to discussion of human assets." $HisOrHer gaze drifts to the side, "However... "
This privacy guideline sounds flexible. $HeOrShe seems to be waiting for you to make an offer.

cutCommLink:Make an excuse and close the comm link]

[Line 5005] [Option Selected: "We're just networking, right? Let me add you on Tri-link... "]
You activate your personal datapad and load up Tri-Tachyon's insipid professional networking service. While making light small-talk with $personName, you find $hisOrHer public profile and add $himOrHer as a connection, swiftly assigning the maximum level endorsement across all notable skills.
"Oh captain, how very kind of you," says $personName, "Now that we're professionally acquainted, I'd be more than willing to perform a quick consultation in the matter of the former employee of interest... though my fees are not trivial."
Bribery it is, then.

[Line 5006] [Option Selected: "Of course. And this fee would come to... ?"]
"$gaPZ_culannBribe credits. Upfront, to my account via, ah, this UID," the administrator says as your datapad pings softly to alert you of the receipt of payment information. $personName smiles brightly again and awaits your response.

$personName cuts you off before you can finish even an attempt to negotiate, "My fee structure is quite generous, captain, and offered with our special professional connection in mind." The smile remains, but $hisOrHer eyes tell you that you're skirting close to an event horizon.

[Line 5007] [Options Given: gaPZ_adminAstraia4a:Pay the bribe
cutCommLink:Make some excuse and close the comm link]

[Line 5008] [Option Selected: Pay the bribe]
"Wonderful," says the administrator as you see $hisOrHer eyes read the transfer confirmation. "Let me just pull up the file on Kelise Astraia... ah, here it is," $heOrShe says with suspiciously little delay. 
A personnel file overlays your comms-link, displaying details of the life and employment of Kelise Astraia.
"Not an ideal employee, mmm," says $name, reading the file. "Insubordination. Sloppy infosec. Failure to consistently engage with company morale programs," $heOrShe glances back at you, gauging your interest. "But that's not what you're looking for, is it, captain. You want to find her. I am correct, yes?"
The file scrolls by quickly, manipulated by a combination of the administrator's hands flying over a virtual interface and subtle use of cyberaugs.

[Line 5009] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Judging by the credits transfers from 'unknown source', I would suppose that employee 379490509 was contracting on the side for a black project from elsewhere in the Company. Not one of mine. Hm." This seems to annoy the administrator. "If I had to guess, that's why she resigned so suddenly and- oh, look at this."
A noisy holo from a navigation sat pops up showing a weathered Venture-class hull. "It's called the 'Hamatsu'. Surveys, scavenging, ... other jobs. Astraia booked the entire ship and requested some kind of modification installed." The administrator is frowning now, an unusual expression for $himOrHer. "No details. I'll have to have a word with the portmaster for allowing this to proceed without filing a copy with the Company."

She falsified credentials but delivered admirably in the end. She's now operating a few," a derisive sniff, "small fleets out of Agreus in the Arcadia system."
The administrator looks at you now, unsmiling. "If I were you and I wanted to find Kelise Astraia, I would talk to Ibrahim. She'll do business." A pause, "Like we are."

rogue Luddic Knight encounter

[Line 5015] The comms flicker and stabilize, the serious face of a Luddic Knight appears before you, dotted by holo-snow.
"You are here, just as Brother Cotton foretold," $heOrShe says, "I meet you $playername, and in my right hand I hold the hammer of Ludd, and in my left hand I wield the sword. Will you repent and turn from the path of evil to follow the blessed Path of Ludd?"
There seems to be some barely-restrained expectation behind $hisOrHer words, a slow anger distilled over years into a force more pure by far.

"Your worship of the twin evils Moloch and Mammon is not unseen by the Path, $playername. A wheeled eye spins, and it is fiery, and it is filled with judgment."
"Know that servants of Moloch can be bought. You consort with betrayers; those with no faith in their heart will sell their erstwhile comrades. Do you think Tri-Tachyon only provides information to your ilk? They know no loyalty but that of blooded silver."

$HeOrShe pauses, then says smugly "Remember that it is a sin to swear false oaths, $playername." The Knight brow furrows just a little, like $heOrShe knows your answer already, savoring that $heOrShe has caught you in a lie.

At last the knight smiles, and it is a smile of cold fury. "Evil will always betray itself, you see? Your heart is polluted with greed, and pride, and deceit. In Ludd's name I shall strike you down, hammer and sword."
The comm-line goes dark. The knight's face hangs in the air like a specter for just a moment of bluish afterimage.

A console chimes, and the rogue knight looks almost surprised, and definitely a little disappointed. "You have... chosen," $heOrShe says haltingly, "But I am still not sure if the path in your heart truly leads toward the Path, or if this is the deceit of a coward who will give anything to save their own miserable life from judgment."
The Knight looks stoic once more, "It is not for me to decide now if your soul can be redeemed- it is not for any of us. But the worldly concern of your Path? That is a burden chosen by Brother Cotton. Find him. If the light of Ludd truly illuminates the Path before you, you will know how." $HeOrShe looks away, annoyed, "Then you can be his problem."
With that, the rogue knight snaps the comms-line dark. $HisOrHer face hangs in the air for just a moment as a bluish afterimage before fading to nothing.

talk to Callisto
------------------------------
[Line 5022] "Hello, this is Callisto Ibrahim of Ibrahim Interstellar Transport and Salvage." 
She frowns and looks you over, assessing, "If you're looking for work I've got all the pilots I need right now, but I can take your comms ID in case something comes up."

[Line 5023] [Option Selected: Ask about the Hamatsu]
She narrows her eyes.
"Is this about Kelise Astraia? It is, isn't it."

gaPZ_calHamatsu1b:"How'd you know?"]

[Line 5025] [Option Selected: "How'd you know?";['gaPZ_calHamatsu1a']]
"Don't even get me started." Ibrahim seethes, "She chartered my ship for some hush-hush salvage operation. Supposedly," she stresses that word with disbelief, "And she comes in demanding highly unusual modifications with potentially dangerous hyperdrive field interactions!"
"Well, I got her to throw in a fair chunk of hazard pay, a rush fee, and a bit more to keep quiet about it like she wanted."

[Line 5025] [Options Given: gaPZ_calHamatsu2:"...You don't sound very quiet."]

[Line 5026] [Option Selected: "...You don't sound very quiet."]
"Yeah," she scowls, "Because disappearing with my favorite starship is a pretty big breach of contract. I'll tell whoever I damn well please. For all I know she ran my Hamatsu into a black hole in some Tri-Tachyon boondoggle search for a more efficient drive field to license back to us poor spacers just trying to get by." 
Ibrahim takes a couple deep breaths, then turns to you, a little calmer. "What's your interest in all this?"

[Line 5026] [Options Given: gaPZ_calHamatsu3:"I need to find out where Kelise Astraia went."]

[Line 5027] [Option Selected: "I need to find out where Kelise Astraia went."]
"I'll tell you what; I want to find her too. There'll be something in it for you if you can get me anything to go on. I'd go looking myself, but," Ibrahim waves a hand through the air; business, bureaucracy, other commitments.
"Better yet, find the Hamatsu and bring it back to me," she closes her eyes, looking pained, "in one piece, I hope. I've got a lot of memories in that old piece of space-junk."
"Let me get you started. My captain on the Hamatsu sent an encrypted flight plan before they left spacedock, after finishing the modifications." She taps at a desk console.

[Line 5027] [Options Given: gaPZ_calHamatsu4:Continue]

[Line 5028] [Option Selected: Continue]
A hyperspace nav overlay appears, "Hybrasil is here. The Hamatsu fueled up and planned to travel to $gaPZ_relaySystem. Whether they made it, I don't know. Outer Fringe, no hypercomm coverage. They could have changed course. That rad-addled Tri-Tach engineer was tight-lipped about her intentions and ensured that the contract had my captain bound to follow changes in flight plan by her order."
Ibrahim swipes the display away, and it is replaced by a schematic of the Hamatsu, with certain additions to the drive field inductors highlighted. "These are the modifications she had done. If we're agreed that you'll find the Hamatsu for me, captain... "
She looks to you, waiting for an answer.

Ibrahim nods. "I would not expect it. I only ask that you try."

[Line 5031] [Option Selected: "I can't commit to that."]
Ibrahim looks at you, frowning. After what feels like a half minute of thought, she finally sighs and says "I'll take a chance with you, captain. It's not like any faction authorities are going to help me with this one."

[Line 5032] She returns her focus to the schematics, zooming in.
"I've had my techs have a look. It seems to be an addition, an enhancement, to the drive field. Press a button and it pumps in a lot of energy all at once, pushes the envelope into a strange harmonic. Theoretically it won't do anything hazardous to the ship, but messing with the default settings of the hyperdrive is never a good way to stay in this business."
"Or alive."

Ibrahim shakes her head, "I figured, Tri-Tachyon engineer? Maybe she knows what she's doing and I could get a cut in on it. What a fool I was. Anyway, I've sent you the schematics in case it helps with the search."
"That's all I have, captain," she says, not hopeful, but not resigned. "All I can say is burn hard, burn bright."

"$PlayerName," $heOrShe says, "You have been looking in places that you should not be looking. Talking to people you should not be talking to. Asking questions that you should not be asking. Your death will be a lesson for others."
$HeOrShe moves with unconcerned deliberation to switch off the comms.

probe-relay in relaySystem

[Line 5040] [Options Given: defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 5041] [Options Given: defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 5042] At first scan, this appears to be a utilitarian probe or instrument platform of the sort used for commercial navigation signaling, staking mining claims, and intra-system comm relays. 
Closer approach reveals a crumbled mass of stealth cladding torn from the hull and drifting in near orbit. Whoever put this platform here did not want it to be found - but a small meteor swarm or, perhaps, light weapons fire thwarted their efforts. Radiation sensors indicate a damaged nuclear battery within. No significant artificial EM activity is apparent.

[Line 5042] [Options Given: gaPZ_investigateRelay:Investigate the instrument platform
defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 5043] [Option Selected: Investigate the instrument platform]
Your bridge display focuses on figures in hardsuits deploying from a work-drone to swarm the probe, equipment cases and feed-lines trailing. Your operations chief grumbles over the comms, enforcing strict call-and-response procedure in accordance with safety protocols.
The salvage team soon discovers a nonstandard miniaturized hypercommunications relay core at the center of the probe's structure. Your ops chief turns from the console to give you that look which says this salvage job just got a lot more interesting.

[Line 5043] [Options Given: gaPZ_investigateRelay1:"What've you found, chief?"]

[Line 5044] [Option Selected: "What've you found, chief?"]
Your ops chief leads you through a live compilation of the salvor's investigation: The hypercomm core is formed from once-carefully arranged loops of dense superconducting material, now bent and punctured by small impacts, its delicate conduits seared by radiation.
The sophisticated post-Collapse engineering is junked but its presence indicates the involvement of a major power-player in Sector politics.

[Line 5044] [Options Given: gaPZ_investigateRelay2:Continue]

[Line 5045] [Option Selected: Continue]
On a hunch, you summon schematics of the Galatia Academy probe relays you recovered while searching for Scylla Coureuse. Understanding the implication of your request, your bridge officers pull copies to their personal workstations and begin looking for analogous structures. 
Within minutes they come to the conclusion that the architecture is wildly different, though the underlying principles are similar. "If I were to guess, espionage got early-stage specs, then this gadget was developed in parallel," your sensors officer says. Interesting.
You nod, then return the bridge display to an external view of the instrument platform. Salvors have re-attached shielded equipment cases to cargo drones, their work complete.

[Line 5045] [Options Given: gaPZ_investigateRelay2:Continue]

[Line 5046] [Option Selected: Continue]
After the salvage team returns, their attendant cargo drone packed with recovered data cores, your technicians get to work pulling data from damaged memory.
The results are scrambled. Mostly. 
Your techs manage to find a few archives frozen in unencrypted temporary memory: logistics requests for basic supplies, fuel, construction material typical of remote outposts. Your comms officer proudly presents you with two mentions of the surname "Astraia" - presumably Kelise Astraia - in the comm logs and, even better, the last target of this comm-link: a seemingly insignificant point in hyperspace.

[Line 5046] [Options Given: gaPZ_investigateRelay3:Continue]

[Line 5047] [Option Selected: Continue]
"It looks like she was in the core worlds, at the other end of these requests," your comm officer reports. This confirms that the black project was operating in this system, and Kelise Astraia was involved. And what of the destination of the Hamatsu and Astraia's current location?
The hyperspace coordinates beckon.

hidden ruins of TriTach base on planet in relaySystem

[Line 5049] Your $shipOrFleet approaches $entityName.

[Line 5050] "Captain, there's something you should see." Your sensors officer calls attention to their display, zoomed to a portion of the planet's surface.

[Line 5050] [Options Given: 5:gaPZ_baseRuins1:See what your sensors officer has found]

[Line 5051] [Option Selected: See what your sensors officer has found]
"Here, here, and here. Fusion scorch. Says heavy lifters, a big operation. But why? There's no settlement, no facilities, no mining. Except-" they pull up the visualization of a graduated radar scan of the vast slope of scree adjacent to the lifter-scorch, "Surface is sharp fragments, even distribution gradient. Suggests intentional demolition debris, and recent. And," with a smile, "-then it gets good." 
The view is overlaid with a deep radar scan. The shapes are blurry, but there are distinct rectilinear forms beneath the debris. 
Your sensors officer sits back, and not without a little pride says "I'd say someone's hiding something, captain."

[Line 5051] [Options Given: gaPZ_baseRuins2:Investigate the hidden structures]

[Line 5052] [Option Selected: Investigate the hidden structures]
You order the hidden structures investigated. Deep scans are run, and salvor teams along with heavy equipment are shuttled to the surface, overseen by your ops chief.
The digging is easy; deep scans from orbit direct the work toward the most promising sites. Salvage crews burrow through the loose material, shoring up the working face with temporary structural foam.

[Line 5052] [Options Given: gaPZ_baseRuins3:Continue]

[Line 5053] [Option Selected: Continue]
After significant progress is made, your ops chief gives you an overview of the situation: whoever covered this place up, they were thorough. Most of what's left are concrete foundations and paving made from local material, a few embedded foametal slabs with sheared-off anchor-points, and a smattering of garbage in small cracks and rifts.

[Line 5053] [Options Given: gaPZ_baseRuins4:Continue]

[Line 5054] [Option Selected: Continue]
"We can tell it's mostly of recent make- talking decades, not centuries. Probably younger," your ops chief explains, waving a four-fingered hand through the display holo. "You can see we excavated the structure with the density anomalies here," they give a bright spot in the display a solid jab, "-looks like a few cheap crawler-drones were left to collect and dump rubbish in a slag-pit. Then they drove themselves in before setting off the demo-charges on the cliff face." 
Your ops chief steps back and nods respectfully, "Pro cleanup. No stray datacores, no shiny baubles. Rarely see anyone bother putting in this much effort. S'all I've got, captain." 
Your ops chief gives a gruff salute and leaves you to ponder the diagram of the hidden base wormed now with several barren salvage tunnels.
Tri-Tachyon. They can afford to be thorough when they want to be, and they are when it matters.

[Line 5056] The lifeless Hamatsu drifts before your $shipOrFleet, its broken body sectioned into your bridge display by a variety of sensors.
Your tactical officer brings your attention to an unusual distribution of burned patches, as if the Hamatsu was struck by exotic energy weapons from many angles, all at once.

[Line 5057] The initial salvage team sweep finds what's left of Kelise Astraia, identified through the biometric data in her Tri-Tachyon personnel record. She is quite deceased. A large cache of credits is found in her quarters in a shielded case.
The holds of the Hamatsu are packed with supplies and fuel, much of it recoverable. The law of salvage rules, even here.
You recall that Callisto Ibrahim mentioned an affinity for the Hamatsu. If you returned this leaky tomb of a hull to her, you could expect a reward. Ship captains sometimes get funny ideas about their first real command, but if Ibrahim is willing to pay...

[Line 5058] Salvage crews boarding the wreck discover that many essential systems are undamaged and the ship could be restored to basic functionality.

You tell Ibrahim about the wreck of the Hamatsu - and the deceased Kelise Astraia. 
"It's a shame, a damn shame, that she ended up like that," Ibrahim wipes away a tear, "That's no kind of fitting end to such a glorious career. Oh, there were some ups and some downs, but there's none to match her."

[Line 5072] [Options Given: gaRH_noHamatsu1:"... Are you talking about your starship?"]

"Of course! The Hamatsu was my life for many cycles."
"Kelise Astraia? Got what was coming. She knew the risks, and was fool enough not to play it safe when compounding those risks." Ibrahim curls her lip, "People like her get good spacers killed." She pauses, "I'm already trying to forget about her."
"So. Captain. Want a job? I'd like the Hamatsu back. Fix it up, give it a new life. Stars beyond, there's a ship that deserves a second chance. I have no idea how I'm supposed to get a salvage vessel into this half-baked jump-point you described, so it's gonna be up to you." 
She looks you over again, with that assessors sweep, "I'll make it worthwhile. Call it 100,000 credits for the hull, in any state."

[Line 5076] Ibrahim looks excited as her image solidifies, immediately launching into her speech without bothering with a greeting.
"-If my sensors and the orbital navigation registry do not deceive me, you have my starship, the Hamatsu! Captain, thank you!"
"I'll give you the $gaRH_reward credits right now and call it a done deal. You don't even have to bring it into a repair yard, I'll handle everything myself. I've already got the replacement hyperdrive in my warehouse, and some excellent engineers on call."

"Oh yes, from our preliminary analysis it does not appear to be a weapon system, exactly - I mean," Coureuse looks down, manipulating the display via datapad. She focuses on the two-stage anomalous device, which scales up to fill the shared display. 
"It has been weaponized. But I don't think this is a weapon. It's too, hm." She considers her words. "Unfocused? General-purpose? You can see elements of hyperdrive core technology here," a section flashes at Coureuse's touch.
"As well as something resembling an Atherton Coil. That stabilizes P-space induction, right?" Another portion flashes.
If you squint, maybe...

Coureuse looks impressed. "Yes! But also no. Um, let me back up," she says, rubbing her eyes. "It's as though the Tri-Tachyon team stumbled upon a breakthrough in - well, we don't know exactly what yet - and someone told them to turn it into a weapon system." 
"Analysis... the implications of what we're detecting - I mean, with the instruments we have - we'll need to construct new ones. What we're seeing is unprecedented in terms of even state-of-the-art Domain-era technology." Coureuse looks away, thinking for just a moment, "Uh. Publicly acknowledged technology, anyway."

"Good, good! You're finally getting it. With some time, maybe you'll be even a sixteenth as good as me. The point was - ugh, you're so vexing, what was it... " Gargoyle taps a cyberjack cable, thinking. Then stops. "- Right."

[Line 5105] [Option Selected: "I think she likes me."]
Gargoyle gives you an appalled look, and says aside, "... They let this one captain a starship?"
The hacker sighs dramatically, flopping back as if stunned. "... 'likes me', by Ludd's AI core, I can't even... okay, focus." 
Gargoyle sits back up. "Baird doesn't do 'like'. She decides what you are going to be to her, and that's it. Anyway, haven't you figured this out yet?"

[Line 5110] [Options Given: 5:gaPZ_tellBairdMods:Tell Baird about the Hamatsu hyperdrive modifications]

[Line 5111] [Option Selected: Tell Baird about the Hamatsu hyperdrive modifications]
Baird listens without reaction to your explanation of your findings: following the lead on Kelise Astraia to speaking with Callisto Ibrahim, acquiring specifications to the modifications done to the Hamatsu hyperdrive.
After only a moment's pause, the provost says "Take these specifications to Coureuse. She'll have my authorization to devote all necessary resources to the matter. We must move quickly if Tri-Tachyon has produced a reliable device to exploit Transverse Jump capability." She frowns, then turns quickly to start tapping at her desk console.

[Line 5111] [Options Given: gaPZ_tellBairdMods2:Continue]

[Line 5112] [Option Selected: Continue]
Baird speaks, her attention divided "If this... Captain, I suspect that you will have to search for a non-standard hyperspace access point to find the Tri-Tachyon black site. Retrace the route of the Hamatsu from Hybrasil to $gaPZ_relaySystem." 
Face illuminated by a newly-summoned display, Baird says "Go now, captain," and disconnects the comms.

[Line 5114] [Option Selected: Tell Baird about finding the cleared Tri-Tach base site]
You upload your salvage team's report and tell Baird about finding the Tri-Tachyon base site which was cleared and intentionally hidden.
The provost nods, glancing through your data. "This fits with what we know of Tri-Tachyon operations. My predecessor, Tomas Kallichore, assisted the Company with-," she looks at you carefully, "-at least one instance of such a black site. The Galatia Academy put its name on resupply missions, presenting them as deep space survey expeditions. The Hegemony never acknowledged this in their persecution of the Galatia Academy, though they obviously knew of it. Or know, now, with the records from Kallichore's Archive." 

[Line 5114] [Options Given: gaPZ_tellBairdRuins2:Continue]

[Line 5115] [Option Selected: Continue]
Baird squeezes her eyes shut and adjusts her spectacles, looking vexed. By the missteps of the former provost, perhaps.
She turns back to you and says, "And, clearly, someone in Tri-Tachyon is up to the same old trick. Perhaps they moved their base after the Hegemony investigation of this institution. Perhaps they anticipated a Hegemony response."
"Enough speculation," Baird says after a moment's thought.

[Line 5116] [Options Given: 5:gaPZ_tellCoureuseMods:Tell Coureuse about the Hamatsu hyperdrive modifications]

[Line 5117] [Option Selected: Tell Coureuse about the Hamatsu hyperdrive modifications]
Coureuse listens carefully to your recounting of the search for Kelise Astraia, of speaking with Callisto Ibrahim, and the strange Hamatsu hyperdrive modifications.
"Interesting," says Coureuse as the upload is completed. 
The engineering diagrams of the Hamatsu flicker back and forth across her face as she scrolls through the specs. "This confirms a few theories we've been working on. And my thesis advisor- um, well if I'm not mistaken-" she freezes the display on a page of equations, "Ah! See right here? They used our work. I wonder how Tri-Tachyon got this. Provost Kallichore, I expect."

[Line 5117] [Options Given: gaPZ_tellCoureuseMods2:"It's a Transverse Jump device, right?"]

[Line 5118] [Option Selected: "It's a Transverse Jump device, right?"]
"Yes!" Coureuse looks surprised and pleased, "It's all rather over-engineered when a simple software patch will do. It's fascinating to see how they've applied these principles to, ah, the hardware application. Experimentation and instrumental aspects of research were never my strong point," Coureuse admits. "I was into theory. Now that I'm back at the Academy, with the resources Baird is giving me..."

[Line 5118] [Options Given: gaPZ_tellCoureuseMods3:"So about the Hamatsu."]

[Line 5119] [Option Selected: "So about the Hamatsu."]
"Right. This ship, the Hamatsu. They went through all the trouble to modify the hyperdrive. That tells me that it went somewhere specific," Coureuse looks at you intensely, "If you found out where they used this, some special jump-point associated with a nascent gravity well that's... special, somehow. Unique? Hyperspatially-speaking?" Coureuse looks off somewhere, thinking again. "Perhaps not unique, but special."

[Line 5119] [Options Given: gaPZ_tellCoureuseMods4:Continue]

[Line 5120] [Option Selected: Continue]
She puts down her datapad and stares into the distance, "How would such a phenomenon occur naturally? Gravitational slingshot of a planet that formed near a hyperspace-accessible primary launched away from its primary? I'd have to check with Astrometrics if..." Coureuse realizes you're still on the comms-call, "Oh, captain! My apologies. I think we're all done? I have a lot of- I need to talk to the rest of the team," she waves a hand, trying to express something inexpressible, "... Ideas. Bye."

[Line 5121] "$playername. Why are you still here? Follow Kelise Astraia, follow the Hamatsu. Find out what Tri-Tachyon was up to at this 'Alpha Site' then return here," Baird removes her spectacles in an uncharacteristic display.

She leans forward, her eyes falling into shadow, "And you've impressed many of the powerful factions of the Sector. In your wake there follows a small army of spies, informants, and opportunists. They will catch up to you."

gaPZ post encounters
------------------------------
[Line 5126] "You are ordered to undergo a standard safety scan of the," the Hegemony $personRank's eyes flick down to read something, "-the $zigguratShipName, as authorized under the Interstellar Transit Accords of cycle 81."
$PersonRank $personLastName looks directly at you again, and without expression says "We wish to avoid any accidents due to allowing transit of an unproven class of ship hull through Hegemony space."
Impressive composure for such a bald-faced lie.

[Line 5126] [Options Given: gaPZ_heg1:Consider your options]

[Line 5127] "Good day, captain," the Hegemony $personRank says crisply. "A hull class of extraordinarily non-standard provenance was recently detected in your fleet by long-range sensors."

[Line 5128] "Good day, captain," the Hegemony $personRank says crisply. "Our sensors detect a ship hull class of non-standard provenance." 

[Line 5129] "Although advancement of industry and innovation is within the interests of the Hegemony and restoration of the Domain," $heOrShe speaks almost automatically, as if from a bureaucrat's script "Certain oversight and limitations are necessary for the safety of all. Let this be notice that the Ministry of Technology Standards declares its intent to reassure the Domain-successor commonwealth of the Hegemony by ensuring compliance of your so-called Ziggurat-class hull with the terms of the cycle 194 Treaty of Crom Cruach," $hisOrHer eyes look up at yours, "which concluded the Second AI War"
The Hegemony $personRank concludes without emotion, "Consider this a warning." $HeOrShe then cuts the comms without saying so much as 'burn bright'.

[Line 5129] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5130] [Option Selected: Consider your options]
Using some excuse, you stall the Hegemony $personRank for a couple minutes to consult with your bridge crew.
"This is not... quite standard, but technically they can demand a scan without a tariff violation warrant," your sensors officer explains."I'd heard of this clause used before, but mostly to set off transports suspected of moving Pather infiltrators and the like. They don't get full run of the ship, just the, um, primary features: main airlock, cargo bay, reactor, hyperdrive. To ensure hull integrity and make sure your reactor isn't going to blow. Theoretically."

[Line 5130] [Options Given: gaPZ_heg2:Continue]

[Line 5131] [Option Selected: Continue]
"I don't think that argument would stand up in court. Um, in a civilian court anyway. But if you deny them, they'll take it out some other way. Probably."
So the Hegemony wants to do a sweep of the Ziggurat-class hull's major systems. You can have internal security keep their scan team away from anything related to the Mote systems. Possibly the goal is simple harassment. Possibly they'll use non-standard scanners to try to get a read on the Ziggurat-class's capabilities.
"What do we do, captain?" your sensors officer asks.

[Line 5132] [Options Given: 0:gaPZ_hegHub1:Appeal on the basis of your Hegemony commission]

[Line 5133] [Options Given: 1:gaPZ_hegHub2:Let the Hegemony go through with their scan]

[Line 5136] [Options Given: 4:cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5137] [Option Selected: Appeal on the basis of your Hegemony commission]
You take the comm-link with the Hegemony $personRank off hold, and explain that you bear a commission from the Hegemony. You fight for the same cause, you hold the same loyalties. If the Hegemony wishes to access your technology, let them ask properly. 
Let them act as officers and speak to your face, not bureaucrats hiding their motives behind old regulations.
By the end of your speech, you find $personRank $personName nodding along with you.

[Line 5137] [Options Given: gaPZ_hegHub1a:Continue]

[Line 5138] [Option Selected: Continue]
"I agree with you captain. Fully," $heOrShe says, "This underhanded skullduggery is beneath the dignity of our long tradition of service. Nonetheless, captain, I have orders I need to technically fulfill. Let the scan team on board then I shall immediately recall them. They won't even bring their equipment."
"Just give me what I need to uphold the letter of my orders, and I will make it clear that the spirit behind them is unbecoming of a Hegemony officer."

[Line 5138] [Options Given: gaPZ_hegHub1b:Accept, allow the fake scan to proceed
gaPZ_hegHub1c:Deny, it's the principle of the thing]

[Line 5139] [Option Selected: Accept, allow the fake scan to proceed]
Your tactical officer deactivates your PD envelope to allow the scan team's shuttle to dock, and you watch on a display feed as the Hegemony technicians step into the airlock, swipe something on a datapad, then step back into their shuttle.
"Thank you for your cooperation in this investigation, captain. You're all clear to go." $PersonRank $personName manages a small, ironic smile, and says "For the Domain," before signing off the comm link.

[Line 5139] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5140] [Option Selected: Deny, it's the principle of the thing]
The Hegemony $personRank sighs, and rubs $hisOrHer forehead as if this is giving $himOrHer a tremendous headache. "I'm trying to work with you, captain. But I won't risk my career for you."

[Line 5141] [Option Selected: Let the Hegemony go through with their scan]
The Hegemony $personRank gruffly accepts your delayed reply, and the scan proceeds with all the tedium you've come to expect from a process carried out by the Hegemony when the bureaucracy wants you to know that they will take all the time in the world, just waiting for you to make a wrong move.
You don't make a wrong move. Your internal security is firm in denying access beyond the remit of the inspections purview, and the scan team - obviously ordered to test your boundaries - stands down and sticks to the plan.

[Line 5141] [Options Given: gaPZ_hegHub2a:Wait as the scan proceeds]

[Line 5142] [Option Selected: Wait as the scan proceeds]
After several agonizing hours, the scan team returns to their shuttle.
"You're free to go, captain," says the Hegemony $personRank. The comm link closes with a brief flash of the crest of the Hegemony Navy and not so much as a thank-you.

[Line 5142] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5143] [Option Selected: Deny the Hegemony access to your Ziggurat-class ship]
It takes a full three seconds for your denial to register a response on the Hegemony $personRank's face. This comes in the form of a slight turn of the head, and a slight furrow of the brow.
"Note in the official log," $heOrShe says, "that Captain $playerName has refused our order to undergo a standard safety scan as per the Interstellar Transit Accords of cycle 81."
$PersonRank $personName then says "You are free to go," and the comm link closes with a brief flash of the crest of the Hegemony Navy.

[Line 5143] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5144] [Option Selected: Make the Ziggurat disappear]
You give the order for the $zigguratShipName to shift into phase-space, dumping passive flux into extra dimensions via whatever strange principle the Mote Inducers influence. Such a maneuver is only possible outside of combat as it requires most systems, including life support, to be operated at only the barely survivable minimum.

[Line 5144] [Options Given: gaPZ_hegHubVanish1:Ask which ship they wanted scanned again]

[Line 5145] [Option Selected: Ask which ship they wanted scanned again]
A look of irritation and distress crosses the Hegemony $personRank's face.
"This is not a game, Captain $playerName. I want you to order that ship out of phase so that we may proceed with the scan. Immediately!"
$HeOrShe takes a deep breath, and says in a lower voice, "We can wait you out. A ship can't stay phased for more than a few minutes."

[Line 5145] [Options Given: gaPZ_hegHubVanish2:Wait it out]

[Line 5146] [Option Selected: Wait it out]
The Hegemony $personRank is both right and wrong. The Ziggurat-class cannot remain in phase space like this forever. But it can last a while, far longer than most phase-hulls. And you know that the Hegemony $personRank has no idea of the extent of its capabilities.
After nearly an hour, the Hegemony $personRank re-opens the comm channel.

[Line 5146] [Options Given: gaPZ_hegHubVanish3:"Are we quite finished here?"]

[Line 5147] [Option Selected: "Are we quite finished here?"]
$HeOrShe looks agitated, "You, you cannot simply disappear and expect the Hegemony to go away, Captain $playerName. I know the ship is still out there," a worried twitch of $hisOrHer eyes upward tells you $heOrShe probably has no idea where the ship is. "We will be watching you. Very closely."
The comm link closes with a brief flash of the crest of the Hegemony Navy.

[Line 5151] "Good shift, captain," the Tri-Tachyon $rank says crisply. "You possess property belonging to the Tri-Tachyon Corporation and I have come to recover it. Surrender the Ziggurat-class TTS Xenorphica to me at once."
$HeOrShe locks you with an unblinking gaze, awaiting your response.

[Line 5152] "Good shift, captain," the Tri-Tachyon $rank says crisply. "Long-range sensors recently detected a certain Ziggurat-class TTS Xenorphica in your fleet; this is property of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation."
$HisOrHer eyes flick down, reading from a screen "Let this statement be notice that the Tri-Tachyon Corporation considers legitimate all appropriate and necessary means to recover property belonging to said company, including use of militarized force, employment of mercenaries or privateers, et cetera."

[Line 5153] "Good shift, captain," the Tri-Tachyon $rank says crisply. "You possess property belonging to the Tri-Tachyon Corporation."
$HisOrHer eyes flick down, reading from a screen "Let this statement be notice that the Tri-Tachyon Corporation considers legitimate all appropriate and necessary means to recover property belonging to said company, including use of militarized force, employment of mercenaries or privateers, et cetera."

[Line 5154] The Tri-Tachyon $rank looks back at you directly, without emotion. "Consider this ample warning."
The comms cut. The Tri-Tachyon logo spins while a synthesized voice asks you to submit feedback on your customer experience.

[Line 5160] [Option Selected: "Haven't you heard of salvage rights?"]
"We are well aware of the rights of salvage, captain," $heOrShe says, jaw tightening "But the Company views these as exceptional circumstances. A great deal of proprietary research has gone into that hull, and the Company expects to make good on its investment."

[Line 5161] [Option Selected: "You're going to have to pry it from my cold, dead hands."]
"Gladly," says the Tri-Tachyon $rank with vicious satisfaction. The comms go dark.

[Line 5161] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5162] [Option Selected: "You're going to have to pry it from my cold, dead hands."]
The Tri-Tachyon $rank swallows uncomfortably, then says "That won't be necessary. We are running a business, not a slaughterhouse."
$HeOrShe pauses for a moment, unsure of how to proceed, then speaks. "You're making a terrible mistake, captain," $heOrShe says. "If that's what it comes to- a word of advice: the Tri-Tachyon Corporation is bigger than you, it's bigger than any person. It's bigger than all people, because it forms something greater than the sum of its components, human and otherwise."
"You'll never win." And with that, the Tri-Tachyon $rank cuts the comms as $hisOrHer fleet moves to disengage.

[Line 5162] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5163] [Option Selected: "What does the Hegemony think of this flying treaty violation?"]
The Tri-Tachyon $rank seems caught cold, and pauses to swallow uncomfortably.
"I don't, um. The Tri-Tachyon Corporation makes no admission of responsibility or guilt in any matter covered by the cycle 194 Treaty of Crom Cruach," $heOrShe say automatically. "This conversation does not confirm or deny any speculation on your part as to the nature of the Tri-Tachyon property in question."
A cough. "I must reiterate my demand: return the TTS Xenorphica."

[Line 5164] [Option Selected: Threaten to give the Hegemony access to the Ziggurat hull]
The Tri-Tachyon $rank's face seems to freeze in place as you explain that, in your opinion, the technology on this ship definitely appears to break the Treaty of Crom Cruach, which ended the 2nd AI War. That is, it would if it were developed by Tri-Tachyon. 
And if the Hegemony Ministry of Technology Standards hypothetically received your survey of a Tri-Tachyon black site, the so-called "Alpha Site", where such technology was developed.
Hypothetically.
"We'll be in touch," the $rank hisses. The comm cuts to a Tri-Tachyon logo.

[Line 5164] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5165] [Option Selected: "How about payment? Perhaps a finder's fee?"]
The Tri-Tachyon $rank smiles, "Now we're talking business, captain." $HeOrShe quickly consults a TriPad, then says "I'm prepared to offer $entity.ttZigBuyPrice credits as a 'consulting fee' in assisting in the recovery of the TTS Xenomorphica."

[Line 5167] [Option Selected: Accept]
Once you signal agreement, the Tri-Tachyon officer is all cheer. $HeOrShe transfers the lordly sum of credits to you in exchange for the command codes of the Ziggurat-class hull.
$Rank $PersonName looks at you over the top of $hisOrHer TriPad, "Your discretion in this matter is assumed, of course," and gives another flinty smile. "It's been a pleasure doing business with you, captain."

[Line 5167] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

We shall of course arrange for a token payment for the recovery of company property - ah, of $entity.ttZigLowBuyPrice credits." $HeOrShe looks at you over the top of a TriPad, "Your discretion in this matter is assumed, of course."

[Line 5174] The Knight of Ludd looks at you in earnest, and says "We will watch you closely, with hammer in one hand and sword in the other." The words lack overt aggression; more a statement of duty than a threat.

"That is it," the Luddic $rank looks down at you suspiciously. "It concerns me - and my order - that you are so little troubled by this machine. When I look upon its face, I confess that I see nought but some spawn of the twin evils of Mammon and Moloch; a hollow child of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. But," $heOrShe raises a power-armor gauntleted hand, "It is not my place to pass that judgment. Yet."

[Line 5182] "Captain $playername." You are greeted once again by Finlay Siyavong of the Persean League Fleet Intelligence Service. "It is so interesting to meet you again," he says with a small smile.

[Line 5183] He nods politely toward you, "What an unusual ship you are operating."

[Line 5184] He nods politely toward you, "I heard that you've been operating a very unusual ship. Quite unique, in fact."

gaPZ_siya5:"It's nice to meet you, lieutenant. I'll just be on my way."]

[Line 5191] [Option Selected: "What game are you playing this time?"]
"No game. I'm having a friendly conversation with you, pursuing a matter of special interest to Fleet Intelligence. Don't believe the holovids, captain - a friendly conversation is often the most powerful tool in an intelligence officer's arsenal."
"It looks to Fleet Intelligence like a capital-sized phase-capable ship. Theoretically impossible. And yet," he extends the palm of his hand, indicating your $shipOrFleet. "And that's its least interesting quality, if my sources are to be believed."  
Siyavong folds his hands together. "If you would indulge me, captain, I'm most curious about where you found such a thing. In your own words, if you would be so kind."

[Line 5193] [Option Selected: "I'm simply operating my fleet. Nothing illegal in the Persean League."]
Siyavong smiles as innocuously as he is able. "It looks to Fleet Intelligence like a capital-sized phase-capable ship. Theoretically impossible. And yet," he extends the palm of his hand, indicating your $shipOrFleet. "And that's its least interesting quality, if my sources are to be believed."  
Siyavong folds his hands together. "If you would indulge me, captain, I'm most curious about where you found such a thing. In your own words, if you would."

[Line 5193] [Options Given: gaPZ_siyaBusiness:"I would prefer not to discuss business."
gaPZ_siya4:"I found it in orbit of a Tri-Tachyon black site."
gaPZ_siya5:"It's nice to meet you, lieutenant. I'll just be on my way."]

[Line 5194] [Option Selected: "I would prefer not to discuss business."]
"Of course, captain." Siyavong's smile takes on a subtle aspect of strain now. "If you do not want to cooperate with Fleet Intelligence, that is your personal choice and we have no, ah, legal objection."

[Line 5194] [Options Given: gaPZ_siyaThreat:"Is that a threat?"
gaPZ_siya5:"It was nice chatting with you, lieutenant. I'll just be on my way."]

[Line 5195] [Option Selected: "Is that a threat?"]
A shocked expression crosses Siyavong's face, "Captain! I hope that you would think better of me. I simply want to ensure that you are well aware of your legal rights in Persean League controlled volume; the League charter guarantees your right to operate starships and engage freely in commerce so long as you respect the laws of navigation and so on."
"So, please. I believe I have interrupted your journey - do carry on. I'm sure we will meet each other again very soon, and I would love to continue our little chat."
"Good day, captain," and with that he closes the comms somewhat abruptly. You get the distinct feeling that Fleet Intelligence is going to be keeping a close eye on you.

[Line 5195] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5196] [Option Selected: "I found it in orbit of a Tri-Tachyon black site."]
Siyavong becomes intent, leaning forward, his attention focused on you now like a targeting laser. He keeps his tone casual, "Fascinating. And what did the Tri-Tachyon Corporation think about this?"

[Line 5196] [Options Given: gaPZ_siyaSite:Explain about the Alpha Site
gaPZ_siya5:"It was nice chatting with you, lieutenant. I'll just be on my way."]

[Line 5197] [Option Selected: Explain about the Alpha Site]
Siyavong looks suitably impressed as you tell him about the secret Tri-Tachyon black site hidden beyond a nascent gravity well jump-point, and your discovery that everyone was dead, and there was a strange ship in orbit.
"This magnificent ship of yours, a Ziggurat-class hull I believe? Wonderful. You said it was strange- I am so very interested by these things, $playerName, won't you tell me more about these strange ah, 'motes' was it?"

[Line 5197] [Options Given: gaPZ_siyaMote:"I don't recall using the word 'mote' with you."
gaPZ_siyaExplain:Explain what little you know about the motes
gaPZ_siya5:"It was nice chatting with you, lieutenant. I'll just be on my way."]

[Line 5198] [Option Selected: "I don't recall using the word 'mote' with you."]
"Oh, how funny," Siyavong gives a little chuckle. "It just felt like the right word to describe the phenomena. Just one of those little coincidences, I suppose."
"But captain," he says apologetically, "I interrupted your story. I apologize. You were saying about the motes?"

[Line 5198] [Options Given: gaPZ_siyaSpying:"Have you been spying on me?"
gaPZ_siyaExplain:Explain about the motes
gaPZ_siya5:"It was nice chatting with you, lieutenant. I'll just be on my way."]

[Line 5199] [Option Selected: "Have you been spying on me?"]
Siyavong's smile doesn't quite reach his eyes. "Why captain, that's such a strong word. Loaded with negative implications, that - no, I understand why you would feel the way you do, and it is a valid response."
"I am a citizen of the League. I would not be so proud if I did not value my freedom, my independence, would I? And we share this admirable quality, you and I."
"Oh," Siyavong pretends to look at his datapad, "I do believe I have interrupted your journey and taken much of your time with my carrying on. I'm sure we will meet each other again very soon, and I would love to continue our little chat."
"Good day, captain," and with that he closes the comms somewhat abruptly. You get the distinct feeling that Fleet Intelligence is going to be keeping a close eye on you.

[Line 5199] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5200] [Option Selected: Explain about the motes]
Siyavong acts as a perfect listener, responding with appropriate awe at the compounded mysteries of the Motes and what little you know of the Mote induction devices. 
As you wind down, Siyavong pretends to look at his datapad, "Oh! I do believe I have interrupted your journey and taken much of your time with my carrying on. I'm sure we will meet each other again very soon, and I would love to continue our little chat."
"Good day, captain," and with that he closes the comms somewhat abruptly. You get the distinct feeling that Fleet Intelligence is going to be keeping a close eye on you.

[Line 5201] [Option Selected: "It was nice chatting with you, lieutenant. I'll just be on my way."]
"Oh, captain. I am disappointed to end our little discussion so soon," he says, looking legitimately let down. "But I understand," he continues, magnanimously, "You have business to attend to and I'm certain it cannot wait. We all have our demands. Such is the way of the world, is it not?"
"Good day, captain. I'm sure we will meet each other again very soon, and I would love to continue our little chat." 
With that he closes the comms somewhat abruptly. You get the distinct feeling that Fleet Intelligence is going to be keeping a close eye on you.

gaPZ Diktat encounter
------------------------------
[Line 5205] You order the main display turned on, and the Diktat officer appears, already barking orders. "You have entered Sindrian Diktat space while operating an illegal class of starship. Power down your engines!"
"By the power vested in me by the authority of Philip Andrada, the Diktat Supreme Executor, I-" a drop of sweat finds its way down $hisOrHer face,"-I declare that this ship is now property of the Sindrian Diktat. You shall stand down all weapon systems and shields then transfer command protocols to my flagship."

[Line 5206] You order the main display turned on. The Diktat officer appears, already barking orders. "You have entered Sindrian Diktat space as a known operator of an, an unregistered class of starship, the so-called Ziggurat-class hull. By order of Supreme Executor Andrada, victory-be-his-alone, we claim the right to perform a thorough scan of all anomalous ship systems to ascertain their propriety in the interest of the security of the Sindrian Diktat."

[Line 5206] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatEncounterNoZig2:"I don't appear to have an example of this ship class in my fleet."]

[Line 5207] [Option Selected: "I don't appear to have an example of this ship class in my fleet."]
The Diktat $rank's jaw tightens.
"Of course. I know that," $heOrShe spits. "But if you did, we would have the right to perform a thorough stop-and-scan, and even board, and- " $heOrShe trails off, realizing the impotence of these statements.
"We're watching you. Closely. Be on your way now, captain. Long live the Lion of Sindria!"
The comms-link snaps off, leaving you with a holding signal.

[Line 5207] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5208] You order the main display turned on. The Diktat officer appears, already barking orders. "You have entered Sindrian Diktat space while operating an unregistered class of starship! We claim right to perform a thorough scan of all ship systems, and said scan shall begin- now," $heOrShe waves a command to an underling.
Your sensors officer whispers a report to you, "Captain, they're performing an active scan. Trying to see everything. But this ship?" They give the hint of a smile, "Doesn't give up secrets easily."

[Line 5208] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatEncounterOnlyZig2:Continue]

[Line 5209] [Option Selected: Continue]
A bead of sweat finds its way down the Diktat $post's face as $hisOrHer eyes are clearly taking in the results on another screen. "... Yes, good, good. We have everything we need to... ah, ascertain that your starship is approved for interstellar commerce. You may proceed, captain. Victory to Sindria!"
The Diktat $rank signs off in a rush to report back, you assume, to the Diktat intelligence ministry. You rest assured that your bridge crew is confident that the peculiar technologies of the Ziggurat-class are safe from a mere scan-at-distance patrol stop.

[Line 5209] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5210] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatCom:"This is unnecessary. I am commissioned by the Sindrian Diktat."]

[Line 5215] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatSurrender:"As you wish." (surrender the Ziggurat-class hull)]

[Line 5216] [Option Selected: "This is unnecessary. I am commissioned by the Sindrian Diktat."]
"This is entirely necessary," the $rank says. "You have sworn loyalty to Supreme Executor Andrada. Prove that loyalty now by submitting to his will."
The Diktat officer's tone softens just a touch, "I understand, captain, that it feels like you will be setting aside a great achievement - capture of a secret weapon beyond imagination. But you know as well as I that all greatness can only come through following the Lion's vision of the future. You must execute the betrayer in your heart and surrender to him. It's the only way."

[Line 5216] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatComAccept:Accept
gaPZ_diktatComRefuse:Refuse
gaPZ_diktatComComp:"How about compensation?"]

[Line 5217] [Option Selected: Accept]
"A wise choice," $heOrShe says, smiling. "This will bring strength to our great work. Perhaps we may end the stalemate with the degenerate Hegemony!"
You order your crew and marines to stand down, point defense envelope deactivated, and the transfer of executive command functions to the Sindrian Diktat XO.
"Glory to the Sindrian Diktat. Glory to Admiral Andrada!" $Rank $personName salutes, then says "I will see that the Lion hears of your loyalty, captain," then signs off, leaving you with only the crest of the Sindrian Diktat navy.

[Line 5217] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5218] [Option Selected: Refuse]
The Diktat $rank's tone goes ice-cold. "To refuse is betrayal. I hereby rescind your commission, effective immediately. Yours is the blood of a traitor, not worthy to be spilled in the name of the Lion."
"You have one last chance to live. Accept once and for all that all you possess may be forfeit to the great cause if Supreme Executor Admiral Andrada declares it. Surrender the Ziggurat-class hull immediately or I shall give the order to open fire on your $shipOrFleet."

[Line 5218] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatComAcceptAfterRefuse:Accept
gaPZ_diktatComRefuseAgain:Refuse again]

[Line 5219] [Option Selected: Refuse again]
"So be it." The Diktat $rank turns their back to you and exclaims, "Let this traitor's death be an example to you all!"
The comm are cut, leaving you with the crest of the Sindrian Diktat. Your tactical officer's console has lit up with red alerts.

[Line 5219] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5220] [Option Selected: Accept]
Once you signal agreement, the Diktat officer's anger cools into loathing. $HeOrShe accepts the command codes of the Ziggurat-class hull with curt acknowledgement.
"That was the first smart move you've made today." The Diktat $rank turns their back to you and exclaims, "Let this be an example to you all! Never let your faith in our great leader waver. We pledge our blood to the Lion and his great movement, forever!"
The comm link closes on their cheers, leaving you with the crest of the Sindrian Diktat.

[Line 5220] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5221] [Option Selected: "How about compensation?"]
The Diktat $rank's tone goes ice-cold. "You are demanding credits in return for doing your duty? Pathetic." 
"I hereby rescind your commission, effective immediately. Yours is the blood of a traitor, not worthy to be spilled in the name of the Lion."
"You have one last chance to live. Accept once and for all that all you possess may be forfeit to the great cause if Supreme Executor Admiral Andrada declares it. Surrender the Ziggurat-class hull immediately or I shall give the order to open fire on your $shipOrFleet."

[Line 5221] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatComAcceptAfterRefuse:Accept
gaPZ_diktatComRefuseAgain:Refuse]

[Line 5222] [Option Selected: "And if I refuse?"]
"You may not refuse an order given by the Lion of Sindria," the Diktat $rank sneers. "We will take your ship one way or another. It belongs to the Supreme Executor, Admiral Andrada, now."
This demand is somewhat extraordinary and would certainly not hold atmo under the laws of interfactional commerce. If you defended yourself from the unwarranted seizure of a starship, the Sindrian Diktat would be on shaky grounds declaring you a pirate.
"Transfer command protocols to my flagship," $HeOrShe demands again.

[Line 5223] [Option Selected: "My fleet will defend itself if you attempt to seize my ship."]
"Are you refusing an order given by the Lion of Sindria?" The Diktat $rank looks at you coldly. "Disobedience is death."
"Transfer command protocols to my flagship," $HeOrShe demands again.

[Line 5223] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatDisobedience:"Death it is."
gaPZ_diktatHub:"Let's talk about this."]

[Line 5224] [Option Selected: "Death it is."]
"You are an agitator and a terrorist," declares the $rank. "For disobeying Supreme Executor Admiral Andrada, I sentence you to death! You have no chance to survive. Treasure your last moments alive."
The comm are cut, leaving you with the crest of the Sindrian Diktat. Your tactical officer's console has lit up with red alerts.

[Line 5224] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5226] [Option Selected: Hide the Ziggurat from them]
You order your Ziggurat-class ship to shift into phase-space, dumping passive flux into extra dimensions via whatever strange principle the Mote inducers influence.
Such a maneuver is only possible outside of combat as it requires most systems, including life support, to be operated at only the barely survivable minimum. 

[Line 5226] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatVanish1:Ask for clarification on which ship you are to surrender]

[Line 5227] [Option Selected: Ask for clarification on which ship you are to surrender]
A look of irritation and distress crosses the Diktat $rank's face.
$HeOrShe crosses $hisOrHer arms, "Our MILINT is well aware of phase capabilities, captain. Order that ship out of phase and surrender its command codes. Immediately!"
$HeOrShe takes a deep breath, and says in a lower voice, "We can wait you out. A ship can't stay phased for more than a few minutes."

[Line 5227] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatVanish2:Wait it out]

[Line 5228] [Option Selected: Wait it out]
The Diktat $rank is both right and wrong. The Ziggurat-class cannot remain in phase space like this forever. But it can last a while, far longer than most phase-hulls. And you know that the Diktat $rank has little idea of the extent of its capabilities.
After nearly an hour, the Diktat $rank re-opens the comm channel.

[Line 5228] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatVanish3:"Are we finished here?"]

[Line 5229] [Option Selected: "Are we finished here?"]
$HeOrShe looks agitated, "You, you cannot simply disappear and expect the orders of the Lion of Sindria to go away, Captain $playerName. I know the ship is still out there," a worried twitch of $hisOrHer eyes upward tells you $heOrShe is unsure of this. "We will be watching you. Very closely."
The comm link closes with a brief flash of the crest of the Lion's Guard.

[Line 5229] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 5230] [Option Selected: "How about some kind of compensation?"]
The Diktat $rank's tone goes cold. "You are demanding credits for following orders? Pathetic. And entirely expected of the degenerate so-called civilization that has fallen outside the light of the Lion of Sindria." 
"There will be no compensation. You have one last chance to survive: accept once and for all that all you possess may be forfeit to the great cause if Supreme Executor Admiral Andrada declares it. Surrender the Ziggurat-class hull immediately or I shall give the order to open fire on your $shipOrFleet."

[Line 5230] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatSurrender:Accept
gaPZ_diktatComRefuseAgain:Refuse]

[Line 5231] [Option Selected: Accept]
You order command codes surrendered to the Diktat $rank. Your personnel and cargo are evacuated in short order as a Diktat skeleton crew - and Lion's Guard marines, and technicians, and intelligence officers - shuttle in to take control of the Ziggurat-class ship.
The Diktat $rank nods, not quite a salute. "Your loyalty to the Sindrian Diktat will not go unnoticed. After I personally deliver this unique hull to the Lion Andrada, I will be sure to mention your cooperation in the affair. May this achievement bring final victory to our great struggle!"
The comms cut, leaving you with only a Diktat holding signal.

gaPZ second Diktat encounter
------------------------------
[Line 5234] The Diktat $rank appears in your comm display, outwardly calm.
"Captain $playerName. I hope I find you well? I understand you've been involved in a, ah, misunderstanding recently." The $rank straightens $hisOrHer uniform, clearly uncomfortable. "I have been ordered to make a statement." 
$HeOrShe lifts a datapad from out of view and begins reading.
"From the office of the Chief High Inspector, the Sindrian Diktat would like to acknowledge that your previous encounter with our special self-defense forces over the matter of a, hmm, starship expropriation order was, ah..."
$HeOrShe looks away, speaking, "The officer in question acted rashly, without clarifying their orders with High Command. The Sindrian Diktat considers the incident to be the rogue action of a deep-cover terrorist sympathizer whose goal was to undermine the authority and glory of our leader, Supreme Executor Admiral Andrada."

[Line 5234] [Options Given: gaPZ_diktatSecondCont:Continue]

[Line 5235] [Option Selected: Continue]
The Diktat $rank looks back up at you.
"Rest assured captain, the conspirators of this officer have been found, tried, and executed by our fine intelligence services. Order is restored to the Sindrian Diktat. Glory to Andrada, Lion of Sindria!" 
$HeOrShe clears $hisOrHer throat after the speech, then says, "You and your $shipOrFleet are free to go now, captain. The Sindrian Diktat will ensure order and stability so that no other such incidents disrupt the flow of trade in this volume."
"Good day, captain. Your discretion in this matter is acknowledged." The comms cut out to the crest of the Sindrian Diktat.

gaPZ_cottonNoFollow:Don't follow]

[Line 5240] [Option Selected: Follow]
You are led to a dark place behind the bar.
In the neon twilight of blinking atmo duct monitor status lights you make out at least two large armed guards by the door.
Your guide has disappeared. One of the guards taps at the door, and after a moment, opens it and holds out a hand indicating that you should enter.

[Line 5240] [Options Given: gaPZ_cottonEnter:Enter
gaPZ_cottonLeave:Return to the bar instead ]

[Line 5242] It is a storage room. A couple folding chairs are set at a drooping table. Bright patterns crawl across an old lighting tube. A pot of tea steams between two simple cups.
You recognize the Pather terrorist sitting in one of the chairs.

[Line 5244] "Well if it isn't Captain $playername." Brother Livewell Cotton beams a smile at you, "I am so glad to see you again in good health by the grace of sweet Ludd." 
With a small motion he offers you his hand to shake in greeting.

[Line 5244] [Options Given: gaPZ_cottonShake:Shake his hand
gaPZ_cottonNoShake:Dont shake his hand]

[Line 5245] "Brother Livewell Cotton, at your service and pleased to meet you, Captain $playername. With blessings of Ludd and all that naturally."
He winks at this, then offers a hand for you to shake.

[Line 5245] [Options Given: gaPZ_cottonShake:Shake his hand

[Line 5246] [Option Selected: Shake his hand]
His smile widens slightly as you shake his hand, "A pleasure. Call me Livewell if you like, and I'll thank you for the sentiment."

[Line 5247] [Option Selected: Dont shake his hand]
He maintains his smile as he shrugs, "Have it your way. Whatever blood's between us, never hurt anyone to be kind." He points with his untaken hand, "Ludd said that last bit once, you know, blessings be."

[Line 5248] A pause, then a dark look crosses Cotton's face.
"Captain, I must declare that it is grim tidings indeed that bring me to begging audience with you. We do see there that you operate a truly unholy creation, this 'Ziggurat'-class starship. For it is born of the womb of Tri-Tachyon greed, the product of meddling in places that human hand ought not reach."

[Line 5249] A pause, then a dark look crosses Cotton's face.
"Captain, I must declare that it is grim tidings indeed that bring me to begging audience with you. We have seen you operating a truly unholy creation, a 'Ziggurat'-class starship. For it is born of the womb of Tri-Tachyon greed, the product of meddling in places that human hand ought not reach." 
He meets your look, "Now don't look surprised captain, there are many eyes and ears upon the daisy that stands so tall as you do. And you stand tall indeed."

[Line 5250] [Options Given: gaPZ_cottonKnight:"Didn't you send some rogue Luddic Knight to attack me?"

[Line 5252] [Option Selected: "Didn't you send some rogue Luddic Knight to attack me?"]
Cotton looks troubled for a moment, holds a finger up, and says "Now that, it is just what I'm saying. 'Many eyes and ears'. I did speak with this knight-errant about you, and we spoke of... concerns. But I did not tell him to kill you and that is the truth."
He looks over at the table as if he just remembered something.

[Line 5256] "Oh, captain," he looks apologetic. "I'll return to your question in just a moment, for I've quite entirely forgotten my manners."

[Line 5256] [Options Given: gaPZ_cottonCont2:Continue]

[Line 5257] [Option Selected: Continue]
Brother Cotton stands, and pulls out the other folding chair for you. "I've brought some fine tea, grown by a good friend. Won't you sit and share a cup with me?"
He pauses, noting your hesitation. "Do sit. You're my guest here in this humble place. And it would be rude to poison a guest," he gives a faux-serious look, "And a sin, besides."

[Line 5257] [Options Given: gaPZ_cottonSit:Sit and drink
gaPZ_cottonStand:Remain standing  ]

[Line 5258] [Option Selected: Sit and drink]
As you raise the cup, Cotton says "Do be careful, it is hot."
He sips tea as well and, looking pleased with himself, asks "Now where was I?"

[Line 5259] [Option Selected: Remain standing]
"You know what, let us stand. It's a damned poor chair anyway - ah, Creator forgive," he makes a sign of penance for his curse.
He stands behind his chair, and pours himself a steaming cup of tea, which he holds in both hands. "Now where was I?"

[Line 5260] "A warning. Yes, it is a warning.

[Line 5260] [Options Given: gaPZ_cottonCont3:Continue]

[Line 5261] "I am asking you to open not only your eyes, but your heart." He lifts a fist to his own chest, "I know, it is a sugary turn of words, but Ludd taught us to be true in our speech in the hope that our soul might shine through the clouds."

[Line 5263] [Option Selected: Continue]
"I am concerned for your soul, captain. The end-times are upon us, and it is up to each of us where we look for guidance. Is it into the pit of Mammon, a promise of gold and hollow power? You carry the fruit of Moloch's tree in your $shipOrFleet, captain. What will grow from its seed, I wonder. And I fear." 
"This is, as foretold by Ludd, another sign of the Apocalypse. I see what you think upon your face- was not the collapse of the Domain's Gates the Apocalypse?" 
Cotton seems to balance rhetorical points with himself, "Yes, and no. It was merely the beginning."

[Line 5264] [Option Selected: Continue]
He sets his teacup down, and his voice rises. He once was a street-preacher, you realize, and likely did well at it.
"The ocean shall shatter and hang in the sky, mixed with blood. The locusts will hatch from the temple of the Adversary. The doom-bringer shall step through the empty door. And," he halts the sermon, smiles, almost abashed, "It goes on like that. I do say, the poetry of the Word takes me, but I shan't bore you if it isn't your interest." 
He picks his teacup up again, and says "All was foretold by Ludd. It's written, here." He lifts a hand to his heart once again, and you notice now that there's a small book in a pocket there. The holy book of Ludd. "The question for us, poor and flawed children of creation, do we look to the light for guidance?"

[Line 5267] [Option Selected: "I think there may be something to what you are saying."]
Brother Cotton looks almost relieved, "Then you are beginning to understand. By Ludd's light..." he looks up, and whispers something to himself. Then looks back at you. "Listen now, please."

[Line 5268] "This Ziggurat, what it will bring... it is my greatest fear and, I confess, my greatest hope. It is clear to me that you hold the tool of the Adversary that will end the world."
He pauses now, and stares intently at you, then nods. "I am not asking you to set it down, exactly," he pauses, trying to find the words, "It is the tool of evil, yes, but imagine a smallarm set within reach of a child. I am asking-" he closes his eyes now, "-that when it comes time for you to decide what you will need to do, you follow the Path of light."

[Line 5270] [Option Selected: "What does 'the Path of light' even mean?"]
His eyes open, "You must learn, my friend."
He takes his small Book of Ludd and places it deliberately in your hands, and pats it. "The word is the Path, and the Path is the light. Once you see it, you will have no need of questions."

[Line 5271] [Option Selected: "I'm not sure you're taking into consideration the complexity of the situation."]
His eyes open, "Faith simplifies such doubts. Your 'complexities' are the whispering demon of... of all of this," his arm reaches out, to take in the Sector in a sweep, "The world Moloch and Mammon have built! It sits on your shoulder, in your TriPad, your cyberlink, and whispers uncertainty in your soul."

His eyes open, and his gaze locks on yours. "The word is the Path, and the Path is the light. Take the next step. If you have faith, you will know."

The energy seems to leave Brother Cotton now, and he looks almost sad as he performs a half-bow, "I should probably go now, Captain $playerName, before the local security forces wake up."
"I thank you for your time, until our paths cross once more. Choose the light."
And with that, he slips out the door, leaving you with two cups, a pot of tea, and a set of cheap autofab furniture.

Brother Cotton's teacup sits placidly in a transparent aluminum evidence container on the station chief's desk. The DNA analysis glows accusingly on the TriPad next to it.
"I-", the station chief swallows, holds a moment, then begins to speak again, "Please keep this to yourself. Our... investigation will notify you if we need any clarifications to your statement. Please, um, see yourself out." 
The chief focuses on breathing slowly, staring dumbly at the TriPad, then the cup, then back.

Mission intro at Galatia Academy
# Sebestyen calls you in, Baird talks
------------------------------
[Line 5299] As your $shipOrFleet follows the automated traffic control signals into a parking orbit, your comms officer calls for your attention.
 
"Captain, I have an Academician Sebestyen on-link. He says it's urgent."

[Line 5299] [Options Given: gaATG_introCont1:"Put him on."]

[Line 5300] [Option Selected: "Put him on."]
Sebestyen appears, looking anxious, which is not unusual.
"Captain $playerName! Whoever I just spoke with- well there's something to be said for common courtesy, and- oh, I should say. Hello! I hope you are well?"
Before you can answer, he continues "I apologize, but Provost Baird wants to meet with you and it's, um, important. That is to say, ah, this pertains to your previous involvement in a... study at the Galatia Academy." He pauses for a moment to let this sink in. "So do please come meet with the Provost at your earliest convenience. Thank you captain."
Sebestyen shuts off the comms without his usual attempts at small-talk.

[Line 5302] [Options Given: gaATG_meetBaird:Inform the agent that the Provost is expecting you for a meeting]

[Line 5303] [Option Selected: Inform the agent that the Provost is expecting you for a meeting]
You enter Provost Baird's office and the thick wooden doors close softly behind you.
"Captain," Baird says, turning to you from her desk. "Good. Sit. We have much to discuss."
Going by past experience, you feel that this will be more of a lecture than a discussion.

[Line 5303] [Options Given: gaATG_introCont4:Sit down, get comfortable
gaATG_introCont4b:Remain standing]

[Line 5304] [Option Selected: Remain standing]
Baird turns back to her desk, ignoring your small rebellion.

[Line 5305] [Option Selected: Sit down, get comfortable;['gaATG_introCont4b']]
"We've rebuilt the theoretical work held in the Kallichore Archive. Academician Coureuse's research now supersedes those developments."
"The Mote induction device from the Project Ziggurat hull you discovered and scanned was key, for it demonstrates truly unorthodox hyperphysics. Tri-Tachyon's use of AI has made a breakthrough, though I suspect that the human element of Tri-Tachyon has only rudimentary theoretical understanding of what they've created."
"We're ahead of them in that respect, captain, so it shall be we who reap the ultimate prize. However."

[Line 5305] [Options Given: gaATG_introCont5:Continue]

[Line 5306] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Our hands are tied." Baird looks up, as if defying some overbearing god.
"Tomas Kallichore played Tri-Tachyon and the Hegemony off each other. It was a delicate balance and he lost control. The Hegemony was forced to act and I was forced to step forward to clean up his mess."
"It is clear that a side had to be chosen, so I have chosen the Hegemony. They are a known quantity whereas Tri-Tachyon is mercurial - and their indiscreet abuse of AI core technology threatens to open Pandora's Box for a third time."
"To this end, I must assure High Hegemon Daud that the Galatia Academy has his interests in mind as we push toward the next breakthrough. I need you to make direct contact with the top executive of the Hegemony."

[Line 5306] [Options Given: gaATG_introCont6:Continue]

[Line 5307] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Presumably we can reassert most of the terms of the agreement Provost Tomas Kallichore had previously promised and subsequently failed to deliver to High Hegemon Daud. With," is the provost gritting her teeth?, "Additional provisions and information-sharing due to Kallichore's squandering of that trust."
"Daud needs to know that there won't be any more dramatic, destructive public experiments on his watch."

[Line 5307] [Options Given: gaATG_introCont7:"So I go to Chicomoztoc and ask to see the High Hegemon?"]

[Line 5308] [Option Selected: "So I go to Chicomoztoc and ask to see the High Hegemon?"]
"Of course not," Baird says curtly.
"The High Hegemon does not simply speak with people like you. Besides, imagine what the Luddics would think if you went to Daud's office saying 'the Galatia Academy wants to talk to you about firing up Moloch's grand experiment again'. He'd be a fool to rattle that nest of small-minded millennialists."
"What you're going to do is get diplomatic credentials from a highly-placed Persean League VIP. Your cover story is you're acting as an envoy between the Yaribay faction of Kazeron and the Hegemony."

[Line 5309] "You are a member of the Persean League in good standing, are you not," she says. "I trust you're familiar with the political situation."

[Line 5310] [Options Given: gaATG_introAskMePL:"I'm technically a demarchon of the League. I could speak with Daud."]

[Line 5311] [Options Given: gaATG_introAsk1:"What's the Yaribay faction?"  ]

[Line 5312] [Options Given: gaATG_introAsk1:"What's your take on Gens Yaribay?"  ]

[Line 5313] [Options Given: gaATG_introAsk2:"Why would this Yaribay person help me? Or you?"]

[Line 5314] [Options Given: gaATG_introAsk2:"Why would Gens Yaribay help you?"]

[Line 5316] [Options Given: gaATG_introGotIt:"Get credentials from Yaribay, talk to the Hegemon. Got it."]

[Line 5317] [Option Selected: "I'm technically a demarchon of the League. I could speak with Daud."]
"A demarchon." Baird speaks the title with dismissive amusement.
"It is the gens that control Kazeron - and half the member-worlds, besides. And Kazeron is the League." 
"If you do not bear accreditation in the name of Hannan, Yaribay, or Kato then you're not going to be taken seriously."

[Line 5318] [Option Selected: "What's your take on Gens Yaribay?"]
"A major player in Persean League internal politics. Gens Yaribay is one of the big three Kazeron dynastic family-corporations, and they favor a... let's call it a 'compromise' which would see the Persean League unite with the Hegemony."
Baird removes her spectacles for a moment, "League-Hegemony reconciliation..."
She shakes her head incredulously. "What is important is that the Hegemony - and the Church - will accept an envoy bearing Yaribay diplomatic credentials having a private talk with High Hegemon Daud."

[Line 5319] [Option Selected: "What's your take on Gens Yaribay?"]
"My 'take' is that they're the only one out of the three gens of Kazeron who favor a... let's call it a 'compromise' which seeks to unite the Persean League with the Hegemony."
Baird removes her spectacles for a moment, "League-Hegemony reconciliation..."
She shakes her head incredulously. "What is important is that the Hegemony - and the Church - will accept an envoy bearing Yaribay diplomatic credentials having a private talk with High Hegemon Daud."

[Line 5320] [Option Selected: "Why would Gens Yaribay help you?"]
Baird smiles coolly.
"Horus Yaribay's eldest attends the Galatia Academy. There was an incident. There usually are when the children of unimaginable wealth go out into the world. They're unaccustomed to boundaries. Imagine the shame: the scion of Gens Yaribay facing expulsion," says the provost. "Unthinkable; it'd be a bigger scandal than that Kato child trying to play revolution on Umbra."
"I'll provide you with a message for Horus Yaribay. Tell him we want to use him as cover to whisper in Hegemon Daud's ear. Horus also wants his eldest child to graduate with distinction from this prestigious academy," Baird holds her hands up in mock-innocence, "Whatever is to be done?"

[Line 5321] [Option Selected: "Why can't you talk directly to the Hegemon?"]
"The Hegemony, for all its posturing about loyalty and honor," Baird smirks, "is an old collection of infighting factions and ministries. Their internal conflicts are all by the book, of course. Usually. But the book, as our Luddic friends can attest, tells a different story depending on who is doing the reading."
"Let me be blunt, captain. Many in the Hegemony would see me - and you - imprisoned or executed for what we've done. The Luddic Church hardliners pray to make an example of the Academy again, and there are enough Faithful in Hegemony ranks that keeping their secrets from the Church is difficult. Kallichore made the mistake of providing his enemies with an excuse. Now hostile eyes watch for another slip-up."
"I happen to know that Baikal Daud is open-minded about my great project, though he cannot act openly. He is, after all, the High Hegemon."

[Line 5322] [Option Selected: "Get credentials from Yaribay, talk to the Hegemon. Got it."]
"Go to Kazeron, in the Thule system," Baird says. "Remind Horus Yaribay of how he and I stand."
"Then, when you meet High Hegemon Daud, tell him that the rewards of the Galatia Academy's research will be exclusive this time. I'll provide you the documents to give him."

[Line 5324] [Option Selected: Continue]
The provost turns from you, to look out the diamond-matrix windows of her office. "Once the High Hegemon's cooperation is settled, we can proceed to the active experimentation stage." 
You can tell she's smiling now, as if she can't help herself, "Coureuse's team is putting the finishing touches on a Gate scanner. We'll need more data, and we need you to collect it. Go and speak with her about this. Do whatever she requires."

[Line 5324] [Options Given: gaATG_introWrap2:Continue]

You understand well enough by now that this is your cue to leave, and on cue you feel the doors open behind you. The mirror-masked guard awaits.

gaATG get scanner from Coureuse
------------------------------
[Line 5329] The comm image stabilizes on Coureuse in her laboratory-office, surrounded by holographic projections of data tables.
"Oh," she says, looking up, "Captain $playerName. Yes, ah, Provost Baird said I'm to fill you in on the new development."
She sweeps away several displays-worth of work; arcane glyphs and diagrams collapse into unobtrusive icons.

[Line 5329] [Options Given: gaATG_getScannerStart2:Continue]

[Line 5330] [Option Selected: Continue]
"First," she says, "this is a prototype device. I told the provost that we're only part-way through the test procedures - we've been using the Galatia Gate as a test case - but I suppose if we make ongoing calibrations and update the firmware via hypercomm..."
Coureuse mumbles to herself as she starts tapping out a new checklist.

[Line 5330] [Options Given: gaATG_getScanner1a:"What exactly is it you want me to do?"
gaATG_getScanner1b:Clear your throat impatiently]

[Line 5331] [Option Selected: "What exactly is it you want me to do?"]
She looks abashed. "I'm not doing a very good job of this, am I. Teaching was never- sorry, let me answer your question."

[Line 5332] [Option Selected: Clear your throat impatiently]
"Oh!" She looks up, "I'm so sorry captain. There's just so much going on, that I..."

[Line 5333] Option(s) Selected: ['gaATG_getScanner1a'];['gaATG_getScanner1b']
Coureuse takes a breath, centering herself.
"This prototype can interact with the Gate manifold itself. It is my supposition that the Gate network is not so much collapsed as it is... folded up. It's there, but inaccessible. Maybe. We'll need to test certain properties, and," she looks at an ancillary display, catches herself, and turns back to you.

[Line 5333] [Options Given: gaATG_getScanner2b:Continue]

[Line 5334] [Option Selected: Continue]
"It was your scan of the Mote induction device from the Ziggurat hull that opened the door. It showed us..." She pauses, then her voice rises with excitement. "Such unimaginable things!"
"Or," she catches her enthusiasm with a skeptical look. "What it showed was highly improbable within the current body of accepted theory. There are entirely new subfields of hyperspace physics out there, in there, whatever - just waiting for first observation!"

[Line 5334] [Options Given: gaATG_getScanner3a:"Fascinating. How will I be assisting in these new discoveries?"
gaATG_getScanner3:"Okay, calm down. I need to know how to carry out my mission."]

[Line 5336] [Option Selected: "Okay, calm down. I need to know how to carry out my mission.";['gaATG_getScanner3a']]
"Right, of course. We're transferring the Gate scanner to your $shipOrFleet now. I'll give you the rundown on the operation."
Coureuse pulls up a new shared holo display, a wireframe depiction of a Domain-era Gate.
An icon standing off about three diameters from the ring itself seems to represent your flagship. You recognize a diffuse bubble around it as the influence of a drive field.

[Line 5336] [Options Given: gaATG_getScanner4:"Looks simple enough."]

[Line 5337] [Option Selected: "Looks simple enough."]
"You'll have to be stationed fairly close to the Gate. And you must ensure that there are no active drive fields within the Gate diameter itself."
She focuses back on the display, "Once you're in place, execute the precoded instructions. The data will encrypt itself and be sent back to me when you're in range of a hypercomm relay."
"We'll need to calibrate the hyperdimensional transform of course, so you'll need to scan six different Gates. We've already scanned the Galatia Gate, so it has to be six other Gates. Then comes the next step."

[Line 5337] [Options Given: gaATG_getScanner5:"The next step?"]

[Line 5338] [Option Selected: "The next step?"]
"...Provost Baird said I shouldn't talk about it," Coureuse says. "But seeing as how you're in the line of fire..."
Without thinking, she glances away, then speaks quietly. "We've been calling it the Janus Device. I admit, it's premature to give it a name, but when the hyperphysics team gets excited..." She shrugs helplessly. "There's no stopping them."
"It's just-" Coureuse notices a blinking display, "The equipment transfer is complete, captain. You're good to go."

[Line 5338] [Options Given: cutCommLink:"Great, time to scan some Gates."
gaATG_getScannerMore:"What was that you were saying?"]

[Line 5339] [Option Selected: "What was that you were saying?"]
She sighs unhappily. Coureuse looks more tired than you've ever seen.
"The team is eager and- and I appreciate their work. But my strength is theory, not hardware applications. It's... it's all so clumsy. And our fabrication equipment! The techs try their best, but the provost expects the world and more. She wants to push the schedule faster. It's simply too fast! I need time to refine the math, to run more equipment tests, to get top of the line components-" Coureuse stifles a yawn. "And get some sleep."
She looks away, "If Elissa was here, this would all be so simple."

[Line 5339] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5340] [Options Given: gaATG_getScannerMoreA:"Who is Elissa?"]

[Line 5341] [Options Given: gaATG_getScannerMoreB:"Elissa Zal, right? From Westernesse?"]

[Line 5343] [Options Given: gaATG_getScannerMoreD:"Elissa Zal. She got me to bring you that... uh, potent krill paste."]

[Line 5344] [Option Selected: "Who is Elissa?"]
"Someone I know. Knew. A friend, or- anyway, her name is Elissa Zal. We did... work. Together. A long time ago. She's a genius with hardware. But um, I made some mistakes, and..." She trails off as she realizes she doesn't want to continue. 
One of her many displays pops an alert which chimes urgently. Coureuse snaps out of it, and dismisses the alert.

[Line 5345] [Option Selected: "Elissa Zal, right? From Westernesse?"]
"Um," Coureuse looks at you like she's thinking; to trust you, to hide something? 
"Yes. I mean at first yes. Things became complex. She got in a lot of trouble. And I don't want to make it any worse."
One of her many displays pops an alert which chimes urgently.

[Line 5346] [Option Selected: "Elissa Zal, the ah friend of yours? And Cavin Pharoh."]
"Um," Coureuse looks at you like she's thinking; to trust you, to hide something? "Not exactly. I mean yes, she is and is. Or was. But she got in a lot of trouble. Not with Cavin; after that. Worse. And I don't want to make it even worse."
One of her many displays pops an alert which chimes urgently.

[Line 5347] [Option Selected: "Elissa Zal. She got me to bring you that... uh, potent krill paste."]
"Yes, the very one." Coureuse smiles, "That was kind of you."
She sighs, "I can't talk about it, really. Something happened a long time ago, and I wish it hadn't gone the way it did. You know? And then Elissa got in a lot of trouble. But she found a way to... to contact me. So we can talk. And we have been." Coureuse goes quiet and looks at you as if deciding whether to hide something or to trust you. 
One of her many displays pops an alert which chimes urgently, breaking the spell.

[Line 5354] [Option Selected: "I am $playerName, a demarchon of the League."]
"Ah, it comes to be now. A recent member, are you not?"
His expression is pleasant, though reserved.
"Allow me to wish you welcome to the Persean League. Do you come to me regarding some matter to be raised in the League Council?"

[Line 5354] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribay1:"I'm here on behalf of Provost Baird, in fact."]

[Line 5355] [Option Selected: "I am $playerName, a demarchon of the League."]
"Ah, it comes to me now. A recent member, are you not?"
Then he frowns.
"And I recall now, you had some involvement in... you are an associate of my cousin Menes, I believe."

[Line 5355] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribay1PL_didBFFI2:"I wouldn't say I'm an associate. We had only a passing acquaintance."

[Line 5356] [Option Selected: "I wouldn't say I'm an associate. We had only a passing acquaintance."]
"Passing. I see." He re-examines you. "To your credit."
"Allow me to wish you welcome to the Persean League. Do you come to me regarding some matter to be raised in the League Council?"

[Line 5357] [Option Selected: "I cleaned up the mess he made with the Church, yes. Someone had to."]
"Of course." He blinks.
Horus quite intentionally leaves it at that. No apology, no thanks.

[Line 5358] [Option Selected: "I'm here on behalf of Provost Baird, in fact."]
"Provost... Oh." His face falls.
"This must be about... I mean, tell me, whatever is this about?" 
You've got his attention now.

[Line 5358] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribay2a:"I need diplomatic credentials from you. I need to talk to High Hegemon Daud."
gaATG_contactYaribay2b:"The provost has a message, if you're ready to hear it."]

[Line 5359] [Option Selected: "I need diplomatic credentials from you. I need to talk to High Hegemon Daud."]
"What?" he says, incredulous. "The High Hegemon? Why should- oh, the... situation. I see."
Ah, now there's that look of resignation you've come to expect from those being blackmailed by the provost. 
"Yes, of course. Provost Baird," he says. "I expect she's provided you with a message for me?"

[Line 5359] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribay3:Send Baird's recorded message]

[Line 5360] [Option Selected: "The provost has a message, if you're ready to hear it."]
He thinks about it.
That look of resignation you've come to know from those being blackmailed by the provost comes across his face, and you know it's already worked.
"Send it," he says softly.

[Line 5360] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribay3:Send Baird's recorded message]

[Line 5361] [Option Selected: Send Baird's recorded message]
The comm line clicks to a holding pattern displaying the crest of Gens Yaribay, an elegant piscine motif echoing the Persean League's colors.
You watch Kazeron commodity futures scroll through the bottom of the display. After a couple of minutes catching up on bulk non-ferrous projections, the comm display chimes.
Horus reappears, looking somewhat more collected. "Captain. $playerName, was it? Yes of course. Provost Baird explained her proposal and I do believe that we may arrive at a mutually beneficial arrangement."

[Line 5361] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribay4:Continue]

[Line 5362] [Option Selected: Continue]
"You shall receive Yaribay diplomatic credentials," he says.
"Mind yourself well with these, captain. If you were to commit some untoward scheme using the good name of Gens Yaribay, we would declare the cryptokey stolen. And then, well, it need not be said that any decent authority would treat with you... appropriately."
Horus clears his throat, keen to move on from the topic.

[Line 5362] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribay5a:"Of course. You have nothing to worry about."
gaATG_contactYaribay5:"I don't need to be reminded to follow the rules."]

[Line 5364] [Option Selected: "I don't need to be reminded to follow the rules.";['gaATG_contactYaribay5a']]
"Naturally." He looks around uncomfortably. "I trust Baird's... good judgment. Naturally."
"Now, I know not what ruse the provost is pursuing. But if indeed you establish a line of communication directly and privately to the High Hegemon," a small smile appears on Horus' face, "That would be splendid." 
"For my half of this arrangement requires the delivery of comms encryption codes to our friend Baikal Daud. One mustn't have COMINT snooping on important negotiations, yes? So do see that done."

[Line 5365] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribayA1:"How can you be sure the High Hegemon wants to talk to you?"]

[Line 5366] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribayB1:"Do you really believe the League can reconcile with the Hegemony?"]

[Line 5367] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribayC1:"I don't imagine the Yaribay outlook is popular on Kazeron."]

[Line 5368] [Options Given: cutCommLink:"I'm off to see the High Hegemon."]

[Line 5369] [Option Selected: "How can you be sure the High Hegemon wants to talk to you?"]
"He'd be a fool not to," Horus says.
"We offer a peaceful solution to the League-Hegemony conflict that would profit all. Daud may be hive-scum, but he's clever. Practical. To pull himself out of that hole on Chicomoztoc he must be a man who understands the compromises one must make to survive."
"In fact, I admire the man," says Horus Yaribay, seeming to surprise himself. "Despite his beginnings. I believe he will accept a compromise that allows us to keep what makes our League great. What does it matter the flag we live under?"

[Line 5369] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribayA2:"I'll be sure to put in a good word for you with the Hegemon." 
gaATG_contactYaribayA3:"It seems to matter to lots of people. Otherwise we wouldn't have flags."
gaATG_contactYaribayA4:"Does this compromise involve you retaining the wealth of gens Yaribay?"]

[Line 5370] [Option Selected: "I'll be sure to put in a good word for you with the Hegemon."]
Horus smiles. "Excellent. I thank you."

[Line 5371] [Option Selected: "It seems to matter to lots of people. Otherwise we wouldn't have flags."]
Horus looks aside, considering. "I suppose. But the masses can be swayed. They are fickle. And, ultimately, they will do what they must."

[Line 5372] [Option Selected: "Does this compromise involve you retaining the wealth of gens Yaribay?"]
Horus narrows his eyes. "Indeed. And by necessity. The permission of the elite is essential for peaceful political change. I need not justify my position to you; the argument is one of practicality, and it stands self-evident."

[Line 5373] [Option Selected: "Do you really believe the League can reconcile with the Hegemony?"]
"Assimilation of the League worlds is Hegemony policy and an obvious condition of their reconstruction of the Domain, to say nothing of the foundation of their claim to legitimacy."
Horus looks to the side, and you get the sense that he is repeating an argument he has made many times before, "Publicly the Hegemony's demand is 'unconditional'. How can they ask that, after Mayasura? They must compromise."
"But I understand their position. They maintain a hard face to buoy support from the masses and lower officers. And," he shakes his head once, "The Luddic Church, in its way."

[Line 5373] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribayB2:Continue]

[Line 5374] [Option Selected: Continue]
"The top leaders of the Hegemony, particularly High Hegemon Baikal Daud must see things more clearly than they let on. They understand that they must hold the banner high and speak of iron resolve to the bloody end - right up until the moment they can present their people with a great victory: peaceful reconciliation. Victory without war. Imagine!"
He looks suddenly self-conscious. "I apologize, captain. My eldest does tell me I have a way of carrying on, and it is not untrue."

[Line 5375] [Option Selected: "I don't imagine the Yaribay outlook is popular on Kazeron."]
"Perhaps not. Not yet among the great gens of Kazeron, where it matters. Gens Hannan would have us head an empire, another Sindria. Meanwhile Gens Kato attempts to build bridges with the other League worlds. While I respect their accomplishments, they take anti-Luddic sentiment down to the level of rabble-rousing fanaticism."
"Besides, what other world in the League can match the might of Kazeron? Our stable of allies is anemic. Were it to come to total war, stars forbid, I think the Hegemony would prevail." He looks troubled, "And then the jackals would tear our vulnerable worlds apart. I fear the Persean Sector could not recover from a second Collapse."
"This is the only way. I hope you agree, captain."

[Line 5375] [Options Given: gaATG_contactYaribayC2:"I try not to get involved in local politics."
gaATG_contactYaribayC3:"Certainly. It's a noble goal."
gaATG_contactYaribayC4:"This Sector hasn't done much for me lately."]

[Line 5376] [Option Selected: "I try not to get involved in local politics."]
"You can't stand on the line forever, captain," he says. "Someday you'll have to choose."

[Line 5377] [Option Selected: "Certainly. It's a noble goal."]
"I'm glad to hear that, captain," he says. "Maybe you can do some good- beginning with High Hegemon Daud."

[Line 5378] [Option Selected: "This Sector hasn't done much for me lately."]
"I am sorry to hear that, captain," he says. "I hope whatever comes of your mission, whatever it is, it changes your mind on the matter."

gaATG, Siyavong asking about Yaribay interlude
------------------------------
[Line 5383] The comms display resolves, and the League officer speaks without bothering to greet you.
"I am $rank $personName of the Persean League Navy. My orders are to facilitate a conversation." $HeOrShe looks annoyed, "With you." $HeOrShe obviously considers this task to be beneath $hisOrHer rank.
"Hold while my comms officer reroutes the link."
The Persean League crest flashes for a second, then another officer appears.

[Line 5383] [Options Given: gaATG_siyavongQuestioningStart:Continue]

[Line 5385] "Captain $playerName. I am Lieutenant Finlay Siyavong of the Persean League Fleet Intelligence Service. It is so very interesting to finally meet you," he says with a chuckle.
"You have a peculiar way of placing yourself at the center of fascinating events."

[Line 5386] Once more, it is Finlay Siyavong of the Persean League Fleet Intelligence Service. 
"Captain $playername. A pleasure, as always. And let me say- I can't help but admire your ability to place yourself at the center of fascinating events."

[Line 5387] Once again it is Finlay Siyavong of the Persean League Fleet Intelligence Service. 
"Captain $playername," he says flatly, "Your ability to place yourself at the center of fascinating events is remarkable."

[Line 5388] Once more, it is Finlay Siyavong of the Persean League Fleet Intelligence Service. 
"Captain $playername," he says, "Your ability to place yourself at the center of fascinating events is remarkable as always."

[Line 5389] [Options Given: gaATG_siyavongQuestioning3:"What's this about lieutenant?"
gaATG_siyavongQuestioning2:"I don't have to tell you anything."]

[Line 5390] [Option Selected: "I don't have to tell you anything."]
Siyavong's smile grows as you resist his inquiry. 
"Of course not, Captain $playerName. That is why I am having a simple conversation with you, and - if you'll let me - I will ask nicely."


[Line 5391] [Option Selected: "What's this about lieutenant?"]
He folds his hands politely.
"I understand that you had a conversation with Horus Yaribay recently. He's an important man. Or, more accurately, Gens Yaribay is an important family. It must have been an interesting chat. I was wondering if you might assist my understanding of why that is so."

[Line 5391] [Options Given: gaATG_siyavongQuestioning5:"Just work. Horus Yaribay made me his envoy to the Hegemony."
gaATG_siyavongQuestioning4:"That conversation was private. Good day, lieutenant."
gaATG_siyavongQuestioning8:"Oh, Baird is blackmailing Horus Yaribay so she can negotiate a deal with the High Hegemon."]

[Line 5392] [Option Selected: "That conversation was private. Good day, lieutenant."]
Siyavong's smile seems frozen in place. "A pity," he says, the smile fading. "My curiosity shall remain unsated; its only fare? Bitter disappointment."
He sighs, and looks down for a moment, then back up, his spirits seemingly renewed.

[Line 5393] [Option Selected: "Just work. Horus Yaribay made me his envoy to the Hegemony."]
"It's funny," he says, "Because despite their cosmopolitan affect, the Yaribays tend to use their own close gen-family as envoys." 
Siyavong appears to think it over, then says "It must be your unique abilities and," he extends a hand toward you, "I would be remiss to neglect accounting for your not insignificant personal charm."
"But there must be more to it. The fact of your recent and recurring employment by the Galatia Academy keeps coming to mind. I simply cannot understand why."

[Line 5393] [Options Given: gaATG_siyavongQuestioning6:"You're chasing conspiracies, lieutenant."
gaATG_siyavongQuestioning7:"Nothing to do with it. But I'd keep an eye on Horus Yaribay if I were you."
gaATG_siyavongQuestioning4:"If what you're implying were the case, it would be private. Good day, lieutenant."
gaATG_siyavongQuestioning8:"Oh, Baird is blackmailing Horus Yaribay so she can negotiate a deal with the High Hegemon."]

[Line 5394] [Option Selected: "You're chasing conspiracies, lieutenant."]
Siyavong's smile doesn't reach his eyes. "Then I'm sure you'll forgive me for indulging my overactive imagination, captain. I will make sure to double-check my sources before bothering you again with such a trifle."

[Line 5395] [Option Selected: "Nothing to do with it. But I'd keep an eye on Horus Yaribay if I were you."]
Siyavong's smile doesn't reach his eyes this time.
"I will indeed. And closely, by your worthy advice. I daresay, I respect your consideration for the good of the Persean League."
"So!" He claps his hands together, "I've taken too much of your time already."

[Line 5396] [Option Selected: "Oh, Baird is blackmailing Horus Yaribay so she can negotiate a deal with the High Hegemon."]
Siyavong freezes for just a moment at your admission. 
Then he starts to nod, breaking back into a smile. "Ah captain, my captain. Truly," he says with overwrought magnanimity, "You are a patriot of the League, channeling valuable intel about this gross conspiracy. Treasonous politics among the Kazeron gens, forbidden science in the black of space, the High Hegemon himself?"
"It's all connected," he whispers with a wink, then leans back. "But how does the secret Tri-Tachyon AI-god fit into this? Is it opposed by a motley cadre of heroic but tragically doomed Luddic crusaders?"
"No need to answer all at once captain, though I know you are more than willing."

[Line 5396] [Options Given: gaATG_siyavongQuestioning8c:"I'm genuinely trying to help the League, lieutenant."
gaATG_siyavongQuestioning8b:"I feel like you're not taking this seriously."
gaATG_siyavongQuestioning8a:"I haven't figured it all out yet, but I will soon."
gaATG_siyavongQuestioning4:"If you don't want to listen, then we're done here."]

[Line 5398] "More the credit to us then," Siyavong says, looking at you skeptically.
"If this is truly how you feel, then I hope we may enjoy similarly fruitful conversations at a future meeting. Perhaps we can all be more forthright when the time is right. But- until then." 

[Line 5399] "To be perfectly forthright with you, captain, I did not see you as the type," Siyavong says.
"But life is full of little surprises, is it not? I'm sure, if that is how you really feel, we shall speak again before long. Until then."

[Line 5400] [Option Selected: "I haven't figured it all out yet, but I will soon."]
"I see. Of course." his eyes flick over and up. Not quite an eye-roll.
He raises his hands, "But I have used too much of your time already, I'm sure. You've been, ah, quite illuminating. So."

[Line 5401] [Option Selected: "I feel like you're not taking this seriously."]
"But of course I am," he says, intent. "I take everything you do very seriously, captain. I watch your actions to see what you do not do, and listen carefully to the words you speak that I might hear what you do not say."
"This has been a valuable conversation to me." He picks up his datapad and taps it on his console conclusively.

[Line 5402] He looks genuinely perplexed. "Um, how interesting. Not a life philosophy I myself adhere to, of course, but there are many ways in the world. I suppose." He looks down at his datapad awkwardly. "That, ah, is everything then. So."

[Line 5407] [Option Selected: "I am an envoy from Gens Yaribay of Kazeron. Transmitting credentials now."]
The state-change across the cadet's face as they realize you aren't some tourist is instantaneous. 
"Affirmative $playerSirOrMadam," their tone is military-crisp.
"Received and thank-you $playerSirOrMadam. I will confirm with OPSCOMM. An officer will speak to you shortly. Please maintain link. This comms out."
The display flickers back to the crest of the Hegemony.

[Line 5407] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeetingSetup2:Continue]

[Line 5409] In moments, the crest disappears and you speak with a real officer, some kind of secretary to the High Hegemon. They begin efficiently verifying your credentials, then pause.
"Captain $playerName?" Finally they seem to look at you and realize who you are, "Of course, I should have realized that you bear a commission. Our records indicate that you have done much good in service of the Hegemony, and much to prove the value of the High Hegemon's auxiliary policy."
"You're lucky." The officer turns back to their display, tapping away. "It will be your great honor to meet with the man himself. Please do forgive the ad-hoc nature of the arrangement; the High Hegemon is a very busy man."

[Line 5409] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeetingSetupEnd:Continue]

[Line 5410] In moments, the crest disappears and you speak with a real officer, some kind of secretary to the High Hegemon who verifies your credentials and schedules you for a brief face-to-face meeting with Baikal Daud.
"Captain... Captain $playerName, I see. Yes, we can fit you in. The High Hegemon is a very busy man, but he has expressed an interest in your matter. Please forgive the ad hoc arrangement. I assure you that it is necessary."

[Line 5410] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeetingSetupEnd:Continue]

[Line 5411] In moments, the crest disappears and you speak with a real officer, some kind of secretary to the High Hegemon. They don't look pleased.
"$PlayerName." A tap, tap at the desk console. "Your record does little to recommend you. But. The High Hegemon will not turn away an accredited envoy from gens Yaribay."
"In the interest of diplomacy, we will set aside your record while you carry out your duties in service of the Yaribays. When you meet the High Hegemon, you will bring no sidearm. You will be searched. You will be expected to obey all reasonable requests or be ejected from Hegemony space." 
The officer-secretary pauses a moment, just looking at you. "We'll be watching," they say, "very closely," before turning back to the desk console.

[Line 5411] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeetingSetupEnd:Continue]

[Line 5412] [Option Selected: Continue]
Before you know it, you have a time, a place, and a visitor passkey to present. A public map database search confirms that you have been asked to arrive at some kind of naval shipyard in orbit of Chicomoztoc.
The officer-secretary did not take time to explain the purpose of meeting at this odd venue.

gaATG Baikal Daud

[Line 5415] [Options Given: 2:gaATG_daudMeeting1:Shuttle to the naval shipyard to meet the High Hegemon]

[Line 5416] [Option Selected: Shuttle to the naval shipyard to meet the High Hegemon]
Your shuttle approaches the naval shipyard in Chicomoztoc orbit. The planet spins below you like a murky brown ocean.
A Hegemony patrol pings your shuttle as the superstructure of the naval dockyard grows like the ribs of some genemod leviathan. The visitor passkey satisfies the patrol's inquiry, and they maneuver toward the next transport on approach.
The landing bay still bears the faded logo of Bhilai Astra Group, a Domain-era manufacturer of heavy weapons and a key supplier to the 200th Legion. It looks like a post-Collapse fragment of the corporation has taken over this asset and now contracts exclusively to the Hegemony Navy.

[Line 5416] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting2:Dock at the shipyard]

[Line 5417] [Option Selected: Dock at the shipyard]
The bay is crowded with transports, military and civilian. Some high-roller has even landed a shimmering S-type Kite, much to the annoyance of the ground crews. A young ensign checks your pass with their datapad then leads you and your bodyguards past the crowd of civilian officials and media drones.
You arrive at a checkpoint still setting up for civilian access. The ensign indicates your guards, "They will have to wait here. And, ah, captain, $playerSirOrMadam. You will have to leave your sidearm with the armorer."

[Line 5417] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting3:Hand over your sidearm]

[Line 5418] [Option Selected: Hand over your sidearm]
The armorer hands it to another man, not in uniform. You look him over: military bearing, subtle cybernetic augments, civilian clothing with the subtle bulk of light personal armor.
"Rivas. High Hegemon Daud's chief of security," the ensign tells you.

[Line 5419] Rivas handles your sidearm as if it were his own. With a light touch he slips the cellmag out, checks its status, then reloads it. He hands the weapon back to you.
"Captain," he says. "It is the High Hegemon's opinion that if you have earned yourself a Hegemony commission, you may bear your weapon in his presence."

[Line 5419] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting4:Continue]

[Line 5420] Rivas examines your sidearm as if it were his own. With a light touch, he removes the cellmag and passes it to the armorer. He returns your unloaded weapon to you.
"Captain," he says, and with a word gives you permission to re-holster your sidearm.

[Line 5420] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting4:Continue]

[Line 5421] Rivas examines your sidearm as if it was a bomb. With the lightest touch, he has the cellmag and casing removed, handing both to the attending armorer. He stares you down at you for a long minute. 
"Captain $playerName," he says finally, as if identifying you in a perp lineup.

[Line 5421] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting4:Continue]

[Line 5422] [Option Selected: Continue]
Rivas turns to the ensign and says "I shall escort the captain to see the High Hegemon." 
The ensign begins to salute but catches themself - Rivas is not military, at least not now - then simply nods, "Sir," before turning back to the landing bay.

[Line 5422] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting5:Follow Rivas]

[Line 5423] [Option Selected: Follow Rivas]
Rivas leads you past a half dozen checkpoints set through the guts of the shipyard. At each checkpoint you both submit to a flicker of biometric scan, then a guard nods to Rivas and allows you both passage.
Finally you enter a utilitarian vestibule. Emergency vac-suit lockers, fire suppression equipment, and safety notices line the walls. A diamond-matrix pane separates this compartment from the enclosed space-dock visible beyond - a perfect, new Eagle-class hull looms, and a gantry hangs toward its bow, festooned with ribbons and a Hegemony banner.

[Line 5423] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting6:Continue]

[Line 5424] [Option Selected: Continue]
Rivas steps to the side, his bulk revealing High Hegemon Baikal Daud sitting on a simple folding stool, his splendid uniform coat hanging from a rack, fussed over by a stylist and an advisor.
Daud looks at you impassively then, without breaking eye contact, commands his entourage: "Give us the room. Five minutes." 
They leave, then Rivas follows after meeting your eyes one last time.

[Line 5424] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting7a:"High Hegemon Daud."
gaATG_daudMeeting7b:"I thought you'd be taller."]

[Line 5425] [Option Selected: "High Hegemon Daud."]
"Captain $playerName," he says, and stands, indeed a smaller man than you expected. 

[Line 5426] [Option Selected: "I thought you'd be taller."]
He smirks, and stands. "They angle the holos like that. Say it's for image."

[Line 5427] Option(s) Selected: ['gaATG_daudMeeting7a'];['gaATG_daudMeeting7b']
His voice holds a deep authority, however, and though you've heard it in holo-casts, with just a few words in-person you can feel why - and how - he leads the Hegemony.  
Daud taps his datapad, activating a privacy field that dulls the ambient murmur of the shipyard's ventilation.
"How's Provost Anahita Baird's project going?" he asks, "Bridged any Gates?"

[Line 5427] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting9a:"That's what I wanted to talk to you about."
gaATG_daudMeeting9b:"Working on it."

Daud taps his datapad, activating a privacy field that dulls the ambient murmur of the shipyard's ventilation.
"Ground rules," he says. "There's nothing to discuss about your pet colonial project. We're not here for that."
"Let's talk about Provost Baird," he says, lightening his tone only the barest detectable quantum. "Bridged any Gates yet?"

He ignores you, lifting a bottle of spirits from out of a small box - baijiu from Eventide. It looks expensive. 
"This is for the newest member of the Hegemony Navy. Eagle-class. After I crack this over hull 0451, it will become the 'Enduring Hope'. How's that for a name?" He pauses, waiting for your answer.

[Line 5433] [Option Selected: "I like it. Looks toward something better."]
Daud raises an eyebrow. "Huh. Didn't expect an idealist."
He reverses and hefts the bottle, like a practice swing, and smiles. "Here's to hope then."

[Line 5433] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting11:Continue]

[Line 5434] [Option Selected: "Not really my style."]
"I get it," Daud says. "The name is for the Hegemony. All the people in it. The Propaganda Ministry has a list of these they come up with. It's not really intended for you."
Daud considers something, frowning, "Or me. And yet..." 
He reverses and hefts the bottle ironically, like a practice swing.

[Line 5434] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting11:Continue]

[Line 5435] [Option Selected: "I don't know. Were you expecting a poet?"]
Daud doesn't move, just thinks for a moment. "No, not a poet. A thug, a heavy. A warrior perhaps? Is that what Anahita Baird thinks you are?"
He reverses and hefts the bottle, like a practice swing.
"Maybe she'll be in for a surprise," he says with a shrug.

[Line 5435] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting11:Continue]

[Line 5436] [Option Selected: "Laying it on a bit thick, isn't it?"]

[Line 5436] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting11:Continue]

[Line 5437] [Option Selected: Continue]
Daud sets the bottle down.
"You're here to tell me our new provost wants to renew the old deal. She'll have to make additional concessions, isn't that right? I suppose you'll want to provide me with the details."
He taps his datapad, opening a channel for you to upload the relevant material Baird provided.

[Line 5437] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting12:Upload Baird's documents]

[Line 5438] [Option Selected: Upload Baird's documents]
As you complete the connection with your datapad, Daud speaks. "What we did to Kallichore was justice. He risked the entire Galatia system, hundreds of thousands of citizens. That might be just one subsector of just one metroplex down there," he waves vaguely in the direction of Chicomoztoc.
"But," his voice hardens, "I will not allow any 'grand experiments' that endangers these people. I expect Baird realizes that any misstep will be met with the overwhelming force of the Hegemony navy."
"She's not stupid," he says thoughtfully, looking at the cruiser through the diamond-matrix pane, "But ambition can make a fool of anyone."
He turns fully toward you, "Do you trust Baird?"

[Line 5438] [Options Given: gaATG_daudMeeting13a:"Yes, implicitly."
gaATG_daudMeeting13b:"I'm reserving judgment."
gaATG_daudMeeting13c:"No. Not at all."]

[Line 5439] [Option Selected: "Yes, implicitly."]
Daud looks you over. "You'll lead an interesting path, I'm sure," he says skeptically. "By now you must know that Baird does not truly know the meaning of loyalty. Not really, and yet..." he puts a hand to his chest, "Here too am I. Hearing her out. So I will not think too poorly of you for your unlikely devotion."
"Tell Baird I accept," he says.

[Line 5440] [Option Selected: "I'm reserving judgment."]
"Don't wait too long. The captain must make the judgment and give the order whether or not they have all the information they need. It is scientists who have the luxury of gathering data forever, asking questions and never quite giving answers, only theories." 
He nods at you, "And you, captain, are no scientist."
"Tell Baird I accept," he says.

"She will be receiving additional demands. She won't like them. She will accept."
He turns, pacing. "The Gates are the question behind the entire Hegemony, are they not? Is the Domain out there waiting to reward those who kept faith, blindly loyal for generations?" 
He stops. "Or was there some grand catastrophe, and nothing awaits us but ruins and the dead? Or will monsters from Ludd's own nightmares pour out to devour us all- unless we are armed and steadfast, ready to meet their threat?"

[Line 5443] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Captain, I need to know if we are history's fools or heroes. Not few among my comrades would say it is disloyal, even cowardly, to ask the question."
He faces you. "I think it is cowardly not to."
"All my busy helpers will be back in a moment, so make it quick. Did that Yaribay blueblood want anything important?"

[Line 5444] [Option Selected: ['gaATG_daudMeetingHub', '$answered', '==', '2']]
Daud glances at his datapad, "You've got 20 seconds, captain. Any last words?"

[Line 5454] [Option Selected: "Horus Yaribay gave me cryptokeys to pass to you."]
"I'll listen to what he has to say," Daud says, and offers his datapad. You upload the cryptokeys.
"I trust the Yaribays to do what is best for the Yaribays," he says, tapping at the datapad to accept your upload. "Maybe that'll be enough."
He looks over to hull 0451, "Or maybe it won't."

[Line 5455] [Option Selected: "You seem to know a lot about what I do."]
"You do a lot worth knowing about," Daud shoots back. "I speak from experience when I say it's not a life I can recommend without reservation."

[Line 5456] [Option Selected: "I want to put in a good word for Horus Yaribay. He desires peaceful reconciliation."]
"Of course he does. Gens Yaribay is only a minor stakeholder in the shipyards of Kazeron, and holds major cross-faction investments."
Daud smiles coolly, "But I will take the 'good word' of Baird's knee-breaker under advisement."

[Line 5457] [Option Selected: "I believe the trade tariffs are too high. Especially for me."]
"Take it to the complaints department," Daud pops a thumb at the Eagle-class cruiser behind him.

[Line 5458] [Option Selected: "Nice cruiser. I've got bigger."]
Daud smirks, shaking his head.
"Is 'measuring up' really what's important right now?" he says, not asks.

[Line 5459] [Option Selected: "The Hegemony AI Inspectors are too aggressive. Perhaps something could be done?"]
"Not negotiable," Daud says icily. "You've been out there. You've seen what happened - twice. It won't happen again."

[Line 5460] [Option Selected: "That's everything I wanted to talk about."]
He raises an eyebrow at you. "Succinct."

[Line 5461] [Option Selected: "That's everything I wanted to talk about."]
Baikal Daud taps his datapad, dropping the privacy field.
As if on cue, the High Hegemon's small entourage returns with a babble of worries over how he'll look on the holo-cast, the need to review talking points for the speech, and his uniform... 
Security Chief Rivas looms, corralling you from the gantry utility room and back through the security checkpoints to your shuttle.

Scan Encounter, Hegemony
# start point from Gate OR fleet
------------------------------
[Line 5464] A silent ring of adamantine material, derelict of a former age.
You query the status of the Gate scanning package and your sensors officer gives you a quick head-shake. Their station interface is spotted with amber warning messages.
"Captain, there's some kind of interference coming from the nearby Hegemony fleet. The scanner can't make a lock."

[Line 5464] [Options Given: 100:defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 5465] As the Hegemony fleet maneuvers to match, your sensors officer reports, "Lots of strangely equipped logistics ships. It's not a cache or resupply, they're just milling around. Getting some funny signals on the hyperspace manifold. It looks like some of the early Galatia Academy efforts to probe the Gates."
The Hegemony appears to be trying to join the race, though they're far behind.

[Line 5466] The Hegemony $rank appears before you. 
"Citizen!" $heOrShe barks, "This is a special naval operation zone - stay clear, or you will be fired upon."

[Line 5466] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5467] The Hegemony $rank appears before you. 
"Citizen!" $heOrShe barks, "This is a special naval operation zone - stay clear, or you will be fired upon."

[Line 5467] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5468] The Hegemony $rank appears before you. 
"Citizen!" $heOrShe barks, "I'm expecting that scan data. Get to it!"

[Line 5468] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5470] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetCom1:"I bear a Hegemony commission, $rank"]

[Line 5471] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetWhat1:"What's the special operation for?"]

[Line 5472] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetMove1:"I need you to move your fleet away from the Gate."]

[Line 5473] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetMove2:"I am prepared to use force if you do not withdraw."]

[Line 5474] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetStory1:"Your operation will fail without my help."]

[Line 5475] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5476] [Option Selected: "What's the special operation for?"]
An appalled look manages to sneak through the Hegemony $rank's martial facade.
"Hegemony naval operations are strictly confidential," $heOrShe says. "Citizen."

[Line 5477] [Option Selected: "I need you to move your fleet away from the Gate."]
The Hegemony $rank's officious facade cracks for a moment. $HeOrShe looks shocked that you'd even make such a demand.
"Your request is absolutely denied," $heOrShe spits. "Citizen."


[Line 5478] [Option Selected: "I am prepared to use force if you do not withdraw."]
$HisOrHer face hardens. "Threatening an officer of the Hegemony is a crime, captain. Count yourself lucky that I have a more important mission than teaching you some respect."
$HeOrShe cuts the comms.

[Line 5479] [Option Selected: "I bear a Hegemony commission, $rank"]
"Transmit your commission codes, please," $heOrShe says, the imperious tone relaxing slightly. "Captain."
You do, and they are confirmed. 
The Hegemony $rank's demeanor changes dramatically.
"I apologize for the harsh tone, captain," $heOrShe says, "Command is really breathing down my neck on this one. It's all strictly need-to-know from those egg-heads in the tech ministry." $HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head, and the meaning is clear: those meddling scientists clearly don't appreciate the grit and operational flexibility required by true military officers.

[Line 5479] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetCom2:"What if I told you what was really going on here."
cutCommLink:"Well, keep up the good work, $rank. Hegemony-strong!"]

[Line 5480] [Option Selected: "What if I told you what was really going on here."]
$Rank $personLastName blinks, and thinks for a moment. "If you were to speculate at our purpose, I cannot confirm or deny the veracity of anything you say."
"You may of course... speak freely, captain," $heOrShe says deliberately.

[Line 5480] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetCom3:Explain about the Gate scans
cutCommLink:"Never mind. Keep up the good work. Hegemony-strong!"]

[Line 5481] [Option Selected: Explain about the Gate scans]
You summarize the story of the Gate research from Tomas Kallichore's failed Galatia experiment onward, leaving out inconvenient details about your own involvement. You tell of Tri-Tachyon's secret research, and the High Hegemon's tacit approval of the Galatia Academy resuming the project.
The Hegemony $rank's face freezes as you speak, and remains unnaturally still, you sense, through sheer effort of will.
"An interesting story, captain." $HeOrShe blinks rapidly, "What is your point in telling it?"

[Line 5481] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetCom4:"Your scan won't work. Mine will. I'll do the scan and give you my data."]

[Line 5482] [Option Selected: "Your scan won't work. Mine will. I'll do the scan and give you my data."]
There's a very long pause. "You do have a commission. I am indeed empowered to integrate your forces into a Hegemony operation on an ad-hoc basis, if conditions deem it necessary."
And more quietly, $rank $personLastName says "Daud, Rao, and the rest pushed the rules much further than this back in the Second AI War... $playerName, I am activating you as an auxiliary asset to this operation."

[Line 5482] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetCom5:"$Rank?"]

[Line 5483] [Option Selected: "$Rank?"]
"Regular forces will withdraw to a safe distance, then I am ordering you to perform your scan of this Gate. Upon completion, you will transmit your data to my flagship."
$HeOrShe stands up a little straighter, "Are my orders understood, Captain $playerName?"

[Line 5483] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetCom6:"Yes $rank. I will carry them out immediately."]

[Line 5484] [Option Selected: "Yes $rank. I will carry them out immediately."]
"Then the mission is a go. Please proceed, captain." says the Hegemony $rank with a little smile, and cuts the comm.

[Line 5484] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5485] [Option Selected: "Your operation will fail without my help."]
"Excuse me, citizen?" You sense $rank $personLastName reaching for the disconnect button.

[Line 5485] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetStory2:"I know about the Gate scans."]

[Line 5486] [Option Selected: "I know about the Gate scans."]
$HeOrShe blinks. "I cannot confirm or deny any speculation concerning the nature of this confidential operation."

[Line 5486] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetStory3:Explain that you are scanning Gates as well
cutCommLink:"Never mind. Keep up the good work."]

[Line 5487] [Option Selected: Explain that you are scanning Gates as well]
You summarize the story of the Gate research from Tomas Kallichore's failed Galatia experiment onward, leaving out inconvenient details about your own involvement. You speak of Tri-Tachyon's secret research, and the High Hegemon's tacit approval of the Galatia Academy resuming the project.
The Hegemony $rank's face freezes as you speak, and remains unnaturally still, you sense, through sheer effort of will.
"Interesting story, captain." $HeOrShe blinks rapidly, "What is your point in telling it?"

[Line 5487] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetStory4:"Your scan won't work. Mine will. I'll do the scan and give you my data."
gaATG_hegFleetDialogHubReturn:"Actually, never mind. Let's talk about something else."]

[Line 5488] [Option Selected: "Your scan won't work. Mine will. I'll do the scan and give you my data."]
There's a very long pause. "There exist provisions to integrate non-naval forces into a Hegemony operation on an ad-hoc basis. If conditions deem it absolutely necessary to achieve strategic goals."
Another pause. "High Hegemon Baikal Daud opened the armories to civilian fleets during the Siege of Chicomoztoc." And more quietly, "And then Rao's antics at Ratatosk..."
The Hegemony $rank winks, then nails you with a stern look. "Captain, I am officially activating you as an auxiliary asset to this operation."

[Line 5488] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetStory5:"An auxiliary? Sure, yes."]

[Line 5489] [Option Selected: "An auxiliary? Sure, yes."]
"Regular forces will withdraw to a safe distance, then I am ordering you to perform your scan of this Gate. Upon completion, you will transmit your data to my flagship."
$HeOrShe stands up a little straighter, "Are my orders understood, Captain $playerName?"

[Line 5489] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetStory6:"I will carry them out immediately."]

[Line 5490] [Option Selected: "I will carry them out immediately."]
"Then the mission is a go. Please proceed, captain." says the Hegemony $rank with a little smile, and cuts the comm.

[Line 5493] [Options Given: gaATG_hegFleetScanTransmit3:Continue]

[Line 5494] [Option Selected: Continue]
After the scan is completed you order your comms officer to transmit a copy of the data to the nearby Hegemony fleet using the operational frequency provided. 
With only one good data set, it's not like they'll have a major leg-up on Gate research compared to the Galatia Academy. Or Tri-Tachyon, for that matter.


------------------------------
gaATG Tri-Tachyon scan fleet
------------------------------
[Line 5497] A silent ring of adamantine material, derelict of a former age.
Your sensors officer calls for your attention. "Captain, there's some kind of hyperwave interference coming from the nearby Tri-Tachyon fleet. Our scanner can't make a lock while they're... doing whatever they're doing."

[Line 5497] [Options Given: 100:defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 5498] Before you open comms, your sensors officer calls your attention and links their display to yours. "Captain, look at how they're modulating their drive fields. They've got their own version of a Gate scanner. Slower than ours, maybe, but similar principles." 
Clearly, Tri-Tachyon has a parallel Gate research initiative.

[Line 5499] "A fine day, captain," says the Tri-Tachyon $post. "We're just going about our lawful business. If you don't mind, please keep your drive field set to a minimum, thank you."

[Line 5501] [Options Given: gaATG_ttScanFleet1:"Please move your fleet clear of the Gate."]

[Line 5502] [Options Given: gaATG_ttScanFleet2:"What is a Tri-Tachyon fleet doing out here?"]

[Line 5503] [Options Given: gaATG_ttScanFleet3:"Leave the vicinity of the Gate or I shall open fire."]

[Line 5504] [Options Given: gaATG_ttScanFleet4:"About purchasing that data ..."]

[Line 5505] [Options Given: cutCommLink:"I was just leaving, actually."]

[Line 5506] [Option Selected: "Please move your fleet clear of the Gate."]
$personLastName looks at you with politely restrained surprise. "I'm sorry," $heOrShe says unapologetically, "But we must turn down your request. We are attending to Tri-Tachyon business and I would ask that you, instead, move your fleet clear of the Gate."
$HeOrShe crosses $hisOrHer arms and awaits your response.

[Line 5507] [Option Selected: "What is a Tri-Tachyon fleet doing out here?"]
"Tri-Tachyon business," $heOrShe says. "A standard survey. You are of course familiar with Tri-Tachyon's line of proprietary star charts, the TriStar Smart Navigation Suite? It is important to provide up-to-date data on potential navigational hazards to our customers."
"Now, we need you to remove your fleet from the vicinity because, ah, your drive fields will interfere with our proprietary sensor suite."

[Line 5507] [Options Given: gaATG_ttScanFleet21:"Sounds like a precise survey. And this Gate has been inert for 200 cycles."
gaATG_ttScanFleet2end:"Safety first, that's what I always say. Good luck with the survey."]

[Line 5508] [Option Selected: "Sounds like a precise survey. And this Gate has been inert for 200 cycles."]
"Indeed," $heOrShe says evasively. "We ah, need to make absolutely sure of that. Our customers demand no less."

[Line 5508] [Options Given: gaATG_ttScanFleet22:"I can't help but wonder about the nature of this survey."
gaATG_ttScanFleet2end:"Safety first, that's what I always say. Good luck with the survey."]

[Line 5509] [Option Selected: "I can't help but wonder about the nature of this survey."]
The Tri-Tachyon $rank looks like $heOrShe is gritting $hisOrHer perfect teeth.
"I've told you what we're doing, and time is money. What is it you want, captain?"

[Line 5509] [Options Given: gaATG_ttScanFleet23:"Perhaps I could purchase a copy of your 'very precise' survey results."
gaATG_ttScanFleet2end:"Sorry, I just like to be sure. Good luck with the survey."]

[Line 5510] [Option Selected: "Perhaps I could purchase a copy of your 'very precise' survey results."]
$HeOrShe looks at you for a moment, calculating, then taps something on $hisOrHer console. Turning the comms record off? 
"We could arrange something. No need to go through the TriStar Smart Navigation Suite. Direct data from me to you, direct payment from you to me." $HeOrShe smiles with undisguised avarice. "$gaATG_ttScanCost credits, let's say. Deal?"

[Line 5510] [Options Given: gaATG_ttScanFleet2accept:Accept
gaATG_ttScanFleet2decline:Decline]

[Line 5511] [Option Selected: "Sorry, I just like to be sure. Good luck with the survey."]
"Thanks," $heOrShe says flatly.

[Line 5512] [Option Selected: Accept]
$personLastName performs the data transfer with admirable customer service.
"A pleasure doing business with you, captain," $heOrShe says before terminating the comm link.

[Line 5514] [Option Selected: Decline]
$personLastName shrugs, "That's the price. The offer stands if you change your mind."

[Line 5516] The Tri-Tachyon $post watches you for a moment, calculating. You can feel the cold anger radiating from $hisOrHer seemingly impassive visage.
$HeOrShe turns and calmly says to $hisOrHer bridge. "Tactical, go to orange."
Back to you, $heOrShe says $hisOrHer challenge, "If you're making a move, do it now. We're ready."

The Tri-Tachyon $post notes your fleet powering up weapons, and nods. 
"This could have been easy, captain," $heOrShe says, "But we'll do it your way."
The comm like terminates with a snap.

[Line 5517] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5518] [Option Selected: Back down]
"I thought so," the Tri-Tachyon $post says. "Go find your own Gate, captain."

[Line 5519] The Tri-Tachyon $post watches you for a moment, calculating. You can feel the cold anger radiating from $hisOrHer seemingly impassive visage.
"Nav, set course away from here," $heOrShe turns and speaks calmly to $hisOrHer bridge. "We need to preserve company assets from brigandage."
$HeOrShe turns back to you, "I won't forget this, captain. The company won't, either."
The link terminates with a snap.

------------------------------
gaATG Luddic sect vigil
------------------------------
[Line 5524] A silent ring of adamantine material, derelict of a former age.
You use your command interface to query the status of the Gate scanning instrument package. The target-finder hangs as it tries to lock on to the anomaly at the center of the Gate's ring. ABORT, RETRY, FAIL? it asks in bold amber letters.
"Captain, there's a fleet of civilian ships right on top of the Gate," your sensors officer says, shaking their head. "There's just too much interference."

[Line 5524] [Options Given: 100:defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 5525] Someone from the Luddic fleet has noticed you and is hailing.
Before you can respond, your sensors officer calls your attention. "The Luddic fleet is in poor repair. Some of their hyperdrives are causing a lot of interference, even in low-power mode. They're why we can't scan the nearby Gate."

[Line 5526] "Blessings upon you, space traveler," the Luddic $rank says. "Have you come to join our holy vigil? There is room here for all. And provided you share, we shall share alike."

[Line 5527] "Oh," the Luddic $rank says, "It is you again. Please, respect the blessed peace we have built here. There is room here for all, and we have little worth taking."

[Line 5528] "Blessed $playerName! May the light of Ludd guide you always. Thanks to your assistance, we are continuing our holy vigil."
"I'm sure the Prophet Returned will come soon," $heOrShe says and smiles radiantly.

[Line 5530] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan1:"What is this 'holy vigil'?"]

[Line 5531] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan2:"I need you to move your fleet away from the Gate."]

[Line 5532] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan21:"Look, you can come right back after I'm done a scan."]

[Line 5533] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan22:"Perhaps some kind of charitable donation could help?"]

[Line 5534] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan23:"This is impossible. Enjoy your 'vigil'."]

[Line 5535] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan3:"As a friend of the faithful, I have a proposal."]

[Line 5536] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan4:"As a servant of the Church, I have a proposal."]

[Line 5537] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan4:"As a servant of the faith, I have a proposal."]

[Line 5538] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan4:"As a, um, servant of the faith, I have a proposal."]

[Line 5539] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan5:"Move from the Gate or I shall open fire."]

[Line 5540] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5541] [Option Selected: "What is this 'holy vigil'?"]
"You haven't heard? I am blessed to deliver you the good word!" 
"We await the return of Ludd! Blessed Sister Fear-not, our spiritual leader, was given a vision by the grace of cosmic pneuma that Ludd would return here from unearthly exile, to this very spot, after many cycles spent in spiritual battle for the soul of humanity."
"We await with joyous hearts and hymns upon our lips. Won't you join us?"

[Line 5541] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan11:"Thank you, but I have, uh, worldly obligations."
gaATG_luddicScan12:"I'd rather not."
gaATG_luddicScan13:"This sounds like a complete waste of time."]

[Line 5542] [Option Selected: "Thank you, but I have, uh, worldly obligations."]
$HeOrShe nods with understanding. "Nonetheless, captain, the path of Ludd's blessing is always before us. You may surprise yourself to find that you have been walking with Ludd all along."

[Line 5543] [Option Selected: "I'd rather not."]
$HeOrShe nods with acceptance, and says "Perhaps in time."

[Line 5544] [Option Selected: "This sounds like a complete waste of time."]
$HeOrShe nods with understanding, and says "Look inward, my child. One day you may understand."

[Line 5545] [Option Selected: "I need you to move your fleet away from the Gate."]
$HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head, smiles beatifically, and explains, "We are maintaining a holy vigil. We cannot simply... move. Our devotion was foreseen, that Holy Ludd may return to us and guide us."
"We would not," even the thought seems a little upsetting to the Luddic $rank, "Abandon the Prophet Returned!"

[Line 5546] [Option Selected: "Look, you can come right back after I'm done a scan."]
"Devotion is not a thing to be turned off and back on again like a datapad," $heOrShe says, with priestly concern but infinite patience for your withered spiritual understanding.
"That's not how it works. What you ask is impossible."

[Line 5547] [Option Selected: "Perhaps some kind of charitable donation could help?"]
$HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head sadly. "Devotion cannot be bought and sold. Besides, we have no need of credits. The Prophet Returned will provide us with spiritual riches beyond all imagination. There will be no poor and no rich where we shall be led on the blessed Path of Ludd."

[Line 5548] [Option Selected: "This is impossible. Enjoy your 'vigil'."]
The Luddic $rank turns $hisOrHer head and says "You misunderstand, enjoyment is irrelevant to-" 
You terminate the comms before the deluded Luddic can condescend further.

[Line 5549] [Option Selected: "As a friend of the faithful, I have a proposal."]
You explain that you have done much for the Faithful, and many works for the Church. You invite the Luddic $rank to ask among $hisOrHer flock, they will testify to this fact, you are certain.
The vigil cannot be held at all times, you explain, because surely the faithful must sleep and otherwise attend to material concerns. Ludd was no stranger to the suffering and the poor, Ludd walked among the worlds and felt their suffering. Ludd did not tell the downtrodden to ignore their wants, despite the wretchedness of the world.

[Line 5549] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan41:"Hold vigil from my flagship while your flock makes repairs nearby."]

[Line 5550] The Luddic $rank nods as you speak, and says "I admit, our ships are old and of poor repair. It would alleviate much suffering if you... provided 50 units of supplies in the spirit of charity. And if, as you say, a vigil could be maintained for the short period required for your, ah, scan?"
You nod piously. This is not for your own self-glory; not at all. Supplies for the weary, and a scan to ensure the safety at all. It is not unreasonable, it is not unfaithful.
"I would accept this proposal, captain," $heOrShe says finally.

[Line 5550] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan32:Provide 50 supplies and go forward with the scan
gaATG_luddicScanHubReturn:Discuss other options]

[Line 5551] [Option Selected: "As a, um, servant of the faith, I have a proposal."]
Perhaps, you explain, that in the spirit of charity you - with assistance from the Luddic $rank of course - could perform a safety scan upon this Gate using a device you have on your flagship. You propose that it could be considered a ritual of cleansing.
This would also provide $hisOrHer followers an opportunity to make repairs to their faltering ships. The Prophet Returned would not want this flock to be lost to hull breaches and life support failure, surely.

[Line 5551] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan41:"Hold vigil from my flagship while your flock makes repairs nearby."]

[Line 5552] [Option Selected: "Hold vigil from my flagship while your flock makes repairs nearby."]
$HeOrShe nods as you speak, and speaks hesitantly, "I admit, our ships are old and of poor repair. It would alleviate much suffering if you provided 50 supplies... in the spirit of charity, of course. And if, as you say, a vigil could be maintained for the short period required for this, ah, cleansing?"
You nod piously. This is not for your own self-glory; not at all. Supplies for the weary, and a scan to ensure the safety of all. It is not unreasonable, it is not unfaithful. You just need to ensure everything appears absolutely above-board for the Luddic $rank.

$HeOrShe nods as you speak, and says hesitantly "I admit, our ships are old and of poor repair. It would alleviate much suffering if you provided 50 supplies... in the spirit of charity, of course. And if, as you say, a vigil could be maintained for the short period required for your, ah, cleansing?"
You nod piously. As a commissioned militant of the Church of Galactic Redemption, these heretics (for that is what they are) are wary of your authority, but more trusting than they would be with an outsider when it comes to handling delicate matters of religion.

$HeOrShe nods as you speak, and says hesitantly "I admit, our ships are old and of poor repair. It would alleviate much suffering if you provided 50 supplies... in the spirit of charity, of course. And if, as you say, a vigil could be maintained for the short period required for your, ah, cleansing?"
You nod piously. These walkers of a, perhaps, slightly heretical path nonetheless view you as close to one of their own. After all, you have made pilgrimage to the shrines, just as many of them have. They trust you far more than the average spacer when it comes to a delicate matter of religion.

gaATG_luddicScanHubReturn:Discuss other options]

[Line 5556] [Option Selected: Provide 50 supplies and go forward with the scan]
You dispatch a shuttle to retrieve the Luddic $rank and a small circle of advisors. As they board, you invite them to a viewing lounge where they can maintain their vigil during your operation. Your ops chief coordinates the transfer of supplies, and even begrudgingly allows a few cargo drones to be borrowed to help maneuver some desperately malfunctioning ships from the Luddic fleet. 
One by one, their engines ignite, drive manifolds sending ripples throughout the local hyperspace medium. The ships of the faithful crawl slowly from the vicinity of the gate.

[Line 5557] [Option Selected: "Move from the Gate or I shall open fire."]
Shock plays across $hisOrHer face, "Truly, you would do this terrible thing?" $heOrShe asks. "It would be slaughter. We are civilians, with few weapons."

[Line 5557] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan51:"Tactical, arm weapons."
gaATG_luddicScanHubReturn:"No, I would not."]

[Line 5558] [Option Selected: "Tactical, arm weapons."]
After a moment's hesitation your tactical officer complies. Furious energies are channeled into capacitors, navigation armor retracted from ports and tubes, and a network of targeting radar, lidar, and more esoteric systems flicker to life.
The Luddic $rank looks faint, and mutters something to an underling.

[Line 5558] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan52:Continue]

[Line 5559] [Option Selected: Continue]
The ships of the faithful start to crawl away, leaving a few stragglers. Tension builds as you wait - will these be martyrs to the vigil, those willing to stare down your beams and guns and missiles and give their lives?

[Line 5559] [Options Given: gaATG_luddicScan53:Wait]

[Line 5560] [Option Selected: Wait]
One by one, old engines sputter and alight, and finally the last of the stragglers trail the mass of the vigil ships.
Stone-faced, your bridge crew awaits your next order.

gaATG Pirates want to extort you
------------------------------
[Line 5564] A silent ring of adamantine material, derelict of a former age.
You query the status of the Gate scanning package and your sensors officer gives you a quick head-shake. Their station interface is spotted with amber warning messages.
"Captain, that pirate fleet is... it looks like they're pulsing their drive bubble. The Gate scanner can't make a lock with all that interference."

[Line 5564] [Options Given: 100:defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 5566] "Yer want the Gate, yeh?" the pirate $rank mumbles while chewing on something. "Well it's mine. So then yer'll have to pay me and mine some tasty nice credits."
The pirate smiles crookedly, showing off pieces of $hisOrHer last snack and some diamond incisors which you're sure were very impressive to some hive gang.
"Give me $gaATG_pirateScanCost credits, then yer can have at yon Gate and do yer businesses."

[Line 5566] [Options Given: gaATG_pirateScanPay:Pay the bribe
gaATG_pirateScanReason:"Does not knowledge provide value to all humanity and, by generous corollary, you?"
gaATG_pirateScanThreaten1:"Why pay when I can blast your fleet into dust?"
cutCommLink:"I was just leaving. Enjoy your Gate."]

[Line 5567] [Option Selected: Pay the bribe]
You order the credits transferred and note their arrival by the big, crudely-modified smile the pirate produces.
"Have yer at it, good cap'n!" $heOrShe shouts, then mashes $hisOrHer control console. The comm-link fails to terminate on the first try, but the second jab gets it, and you are relieved of the pirate's virtual presence.

[Line 5568] [Option Selected: "Does not knowledge provide value to all humanity and, by generous corollary, you?"]
The pirate looks confused and possibly a little upset. 
"Wha?" $heOrShe says through another bite from an emergency combat ration bar.

[Line 5568] [Options Given: gaATG_pirateScanReason2:"I come to do science and pursue applications for new discoveries."
gaATG_pirateScanPay:Pay the bribe
gaATG_pirateScanThreaten1:"Why pay when I can blast your fleet into dust?"

[Line 5569] [Option Selected: "I come to do science and pursue applications for new discoveries."]
"Just don't yer be doing that without buying me a drink first, ha-ha-ha," the pirate turns to laugh at $hisOrHer crew, who obediently join in.
$HeOrShe turns back, "So will yer be paying me to burn out, or?"

[Line 5569] [Options Given: gaATG_pirateScanReason3:"You misunderstand... " (explain)"
gaATG_pirateScanPay:Pay the bribe
gaATG_pirateScanThreaten1:"Why pay when I can blast your fleet into dust?"
cutCommLink:"I was just leaving. Enjoy your Gate."]

[Line 5570] [Option Selected: "You misunderstand... " (explain)"]
Painstakingly, you walk the pirate step by step through an argument for a universal ethics of collective betterment with the particular application of allowing you to perform your scan gratis. It is a gamble, you admit - and the pirate understands gambling, enthusiastically - but one in which we all bet for potential wins from the universe itself.
This analogy bears more fruit, and you manage to advance a narrative throughline of cheating the house, where the pot to be won is the corpus of hyperspace physics knowledge and the house is the natural world itself. A crude approach, you reflect, but you're willing to compromise holistic fidelity to hurry the conversation along.
You prompt the pirate: "So by allowing me access to this Gate..."

[Line 5570] [Options Given: gaATG_pirateScanReason4:Wait for it]

[Line 5571] [Option Selected: Wait for it]
"I, I-" the pirate speaks hesitatingly, "...make richer... both of us. More." 

[Line 5571] [Options Given: gaATG_pirateScanReason5:"Exactly!"]

[Line 5572] [Option Selected: "Exactly!"]
"Okay." The pirate sits back, tired. "We will go now. So yer better come back and pay me lots more credits in, uh, a cycle? Or we'll make you eat laser."

[Line 5572] [Options Given: gaATG_pirateScanReason6:"Close enough."]

[Line 5573] [Option Selected: "Close enough."]
As the comms-link is terminated, the pirate fleet powers down weapons and turns away from the Gate.
Your attempt to instill a new ethos seems to have failed, but you judge it unlikely that this particular pirate captain will last long enough to attempt to collect what they think you're offering in a cycle anyway. And, more important, the Gate is clear of their drive-field interference.

[Line 5574] [Option Selected: "Why pay when I can blast your fleet into dust?"]
"Yer'll get it now!" the pirate shouts, and turns to $hisOrHer crew "Make for combat!"
The link flickers and terminates as the pirate's electronic warfare matrix comes online.


------------------------------
Derelict gate scanning ship
------------------------------
[Line 5580] An Apogee-class derelict drifts nearby the Gate. This isn't a Gate-hulk, one of the dead ships left from the chaos of the collapse. The damage is much more recent; the hull still retains heat from normal ship operation.
Your sensors officer sweeps the hulk, feeding you status updates. There don't seem to be signs of hasty cuts to cargo bay doors, as Pirates and sometimes Pathers are wont to make. Might mean something, might mean nothing.

[Line 5581] The initial salvage team finds the hull in relatively good condition for a derelict ship.
The salvor's reports trickle in. A makeshift instrument package has been added to one of the Apogee's sensor bulbs. It has certain features that resemble the Gate scanner provided to you by Coureuse though this one is damaged beyond repair. A cursory sweep of weapons and shields indicates that whatever attack crippled this ship, it must have come as a surprise: the weapons are unfired, and the shield capacitors lack any trace of recent flux build-up.
Your ops chief scowls, "Mark me, it's treachery when you see it like this. Couldn't tell you who did it. Sensor logs are scrubbed down to the crystal. Registry says the ship was hired out of Madeira, crew of mixed civie spacers."


------------------------------
Gate Scan Jammer
------------------------------
[Line 5585] A silent ring of adamantine material, derelict of a former age.
You query the status of the Gate scanning package and your sensors officer gives you a quick head-shake. Their station interface is spotted with amber warning messages.
"Captain, there's interference coming from... some kind of microsat in the middle of the Gate. The scanner can't make a lock."

[Line 5585] [Options Given: gaATG_scanJammer1:"A microsat?"
defaultLeave:"Looks suspicious. Abort scan.]

[Line 5586] [Option Selected: "A microsat?"]
"An active scan picked it up once the Gate scanner, uh, told us where to look. It's very small, but somehow it's causing interference in the hyperspace manifold. Here, I can-" your sensors office taps a few controls and the Gate takes over the bridge display. An icon blinks near the center of the Gate.
Your sensors officer zooms in a subdisplay of visual EM. It's a dark, small shape, slowly rotating. Like a piece of space junk- with a power source.

[Line 5586] [Options Given: gaATG_scanJammerDestroy1:Blow it up
gaATG_scanJammerRecover1:Send a team to recover the microsat]

[Line 5587] [Option Selected: Blow it up]
Your order the microsat destroyed. Tactical maintains a professional face but you can almost hear the grin in their response, "Aye, captain."
All stations are set to yellow alert. Weapons lock on target. 

[Line 5587] [Options Given: gaATG_scanJammerDestroy2:"Fire."]

[Line 5588] [Option Selected: "Fire."]
The microsat disappears into a rapidly expanding cloud of energetic particles. You could swear you felt an imperceptible tremble through the hull of your flagship, and then nothing. 
Your bridge officers hold their breath in anticipation of some reaction; a signal, an attack, a response. As the seconds tick away, there is nothing, and the tension eases.
Your sensors officer signals for your attention, "Captain. We've got a lock from the Gate scanner. Can proceed at your order, $playerSirOrMadam."

[Line 5589] [Option Selected: Send a team to recover the microsat]
At your command, your ops chief starts grumbling orders to the on-duty salvage teams. You watch as a pair of drones launch, figures in hardsuits dangling from hand-rails on the trailing drone.
The occupied drone halts at one Gate diameter from the microsat, leaving the other to recover the microsat via a remote operation.
At final approach, a manipulator arm is extended, and the clamps squeeze together in perfect time with the microsat's own slow rotation.
A burst of light fuzzes the display feed.

[Line 5589] [Options Given: gaATG_scanJammerRecover2:Continue]

[Line 5590] [Option Selected: Continue]
The display stutters and reforms. Your ops chief never even flinched. "Self-destruct charge," they report.
It's a standard operation from there. The salvage team manages to collect most of the pieces of microsat, and you view the assembled collection laid out in a small workspace off the primary cargo bay. 
"Generic parts, more or less. Could be anyone who built it," your ops chief explains. "Unusual design to do what it does though. Y'know, to jam the Gate scanning what's-it," their eyes flicker to your tech officer, daring them to try to explain Coureuse's latest iteration on unified hyperfield theory again.

[Line 5590] [Options Given: gaATG_scanJammerRecover3:Continue]

[Line 5591] [Option Selected: Continue]
You're left only to speculate. At least the device itself is no longer blocking your scan.
Your sensors officer signals for your attention, "Captain. We've got a lock from the Gate scanner. Can proceed at your order, $playerSirOrMadam."


------------------------------
Gate Scan tripwire alarm
------------------------------
[Line 5594] A silent ring of adamantine material, derelict of a former age.
There's a chime. "Wait," your sensors officer says, "There's a hypercomm pulse, uh, source near the Gate, some kind of microsat."
Your bridge crew quickly identifies a bogey hidden on the opposite side of the Gate and center it in the primary display. Before you can give a follow-up order there's a small flash of light, leaving only a rapidly expanding cloud of debris.
Your comms officer reports, "That was a coded pulse, very short. Probably a tactical scan of this $shipOrFleet. Then it self-destructed. Whoever left that microsat knows exactly who we are."


------------------------------
gaATG suspicious gate scan scavenger
------------------------------
[Line 5597] Your sensors officer speaks, "Captain, you should know that they've been hitting us with some esoteric scanner sweeps ever since we entered proximity of the Gate. They probably don't think we know about it, but," they say with a hint of pride, "I caught some funny-looking background radiation."

[Line 5598] The scavenger fleet's captain smiles unconvincingly as the comm image resolves.
"Greetings starfarer!" $heOrShe says, thick with bonhomie. "Seen any good pickings around here? It's been a bit sparse for us, ha-ha, maybe we could use a tip or two."

[Line 5599] [Options Given: gaATG_scavScanDialog1:"Sorry, no."]

[Line 5600] [Options Given: gaATG_scavScanDialog2:"There's a big cache on the other side of the system. My hold's full, so it's all yours."]

[Line 5601] [Options Given: gaATG_scavScanDialog21:"There's nothing here. Why stay?"]

[Line 5602] [Options Given: gaATG_scavScanDialog22:"I think it's time for you to go. I insist."]

[Line 5603] [Options Given: gaATG_scavScanDialog3:"Why are you lingering near the Gate?"]

[Line 5608] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5609] [Option Selected: "Sorry, no."]
"Too bad, too bad," $heOrShe says. A moments awkward pause, $heOrShe licks $hisOrHer lips, then says, "So, um. Is there anything I can do for you, captain?"

[Line 5610] [Option Selected: "I'm going to need you to move away from the Gate."]
A long pause. Reluctantly the 'scavenger' concedes.
"Of course, of course. Captain. Guess you found something my scanners didn't 'eh? Well, that's the luck of the draw, like they say, and maybe it just isn't my day."
"Burn bright, my friend," $heOrShe concludes, and reaches for $hisOrHer comm cut-off.

[Line 5610] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5611] [Option Selected: "There's a big cache on the other side of the system. My hold's full, so it's all yours."]
"Oh, how wonderful! We'll have to burn on over there just as soon as I'm done my sweep here." $heOrShe smiles nervously, "You're too kind, captain. I'm sorry that I can't offer any good finds in return."

[Line 5612] [Option Selected: "There's nothing here. Why stay?"]
"Just, ah. Being sure, right? Might have missed something on the first sweep. And don't think I don't appreciate your help, captain. Just, um." 
$HeOrShe takes a second to think of an excuse, then finds it. "Ah, among us scavengers, see, it's so much better to find your own score than someone elses' leavings, no offense meant captain. Isn't that right?"

[Line 5613] [Option Selected: "I think it's time for you to go. I insist."]
"Ha-ha," that fake laugh again. A drop of sweat wobbles on the scavenger's forehead. 
"I suppose, um. If you insist, captain, I'll be on your way. I should count myself lucky that I have you looking out for my good fortune, eh?"
"Burn bright, my friend," $heOrShe concludes shakily, and reaches for $hisOrHer comm cut-off.

[Line 5613] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5614] [Option Selected: "Why are you lingering near the Gate?"]
"What, that old thing? Ha-ha." $HisOrHer strained fake laugh is somewhat grating upon repeat, you discover. 
"Well you know it is. We're all old hands at scavenging here, aren't we, fellow spacer? Sometimes you find lots of little wrecks around these Gates back from, y'know." $HeOrShe trails off. 
Then begins to speak again as you fail to fill $hisOrHer silence. "Need to double and triple check to be sure, isn't that right? Maybe someone missed something out here and that'll be my lucky day," $heOrShe says. "So um. Did you need anything?"

[Line 5615] [Option Selected: "It sure looks like you're watching the Gate. Expect something to come out?"]
"The Gate? Ha-ha ha-ha, oh Captain $playerName, you're a treasure." $HisOrHer fake laughter settles down quite quickly, and you see a drop of sweat wobble on $hisOrHer brow.
"Well, you know us spacers. Always telling stories about the Gates, isn't that right. Watch your back around an empty Gate, they say. Maybe it's just my, my what'sit, unconscious mind."

[Line 5616] [Option Selected: "I don't recall giving you my name."]
"I uh- of course, captain. It's in the comm link metadata of course. No offense intended, just being polite. We're all friends here, isn't that right, looking out for one another. Spacers got to stick together, that's what I always say."

[Line 5617] [Option Selected: "Who are you working for?"]
"Ha-ha. Oh, captain. Myself, naturally. Well and uh, I've got an investor or two back on..." $heOrShe is visibly reaching for an answer, "Back on..." 
It comes to $himOrHer. "Nomios, of course. Partners, right. Equal shares and whatnot. All on the up-and-up. Um, how about you?"


------------------------------
gaATG return scans to Coureuse first, no deal with Daud
------------------------------
[Line 5620] "The automated transmitter returns worked perfectly. It's-," a series of expressions crosses Coureuse's face, and she begins to speak in half-starts at least three times before giving up. Instead, she laughs. "It's amazing, captain," she says, her eyes tracking back to the holo display, focusing back on the data.
"I have... so much to do," she says, distracted.

[Line 5621] Coureuse looks up from her console, a cloud of holo data shifting to adjust to her gaze, "Oh, it's you! The research team, ah, we're processing the data you've collected from the Gates."
"We've- we can't really talk about it until Provost Baird gives the go-ahead," she says. "But between you and me, the results are... exciting, but there are risks." 

[Line 5621] [Options Given: gaATG_returnScansToCoureuse1:"Risks?"]

[Line 5622] [Option Selected: "Risks?"]
She looks off grimly, somewhere beyond her terminal's pick-up. "I shouldn't talk about it. Like this. I'll raise my concerns in the meeting with Provost Baird. Hopefully she listens."


------------------------------
Return to Baird w/o Daud Deal
------------------------------
[Line 5625] As the comms display resolves, Baird is glancing over some status report blinking in her holodisplay. After a fraction of a second, she dismisses it with a flick.
"It is absolutely essential that we secure High Hegemon Baikal Daud's approval," she says, "At least covertly, before we begin the experimentation phase. Everything is contingent on the ability to proceed without political interference."
"I trust you'll make good time, captain," she concludes, then terminates the commlink without letting you get a word in.

[Line 5625] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5626] "That is what this academy has always lacked - a willingness to move past observation to use our knowledge to act upon the world. Get me Daud's cooperation, captain. Then we'll write history."
The provost terminates the commlink without letting you get a word in.

[Line 5626] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]


------------------------------
Return to Baird with Daud Deal, but w/o 6 scans
------------------------------
[Line 5628] The comm display resolves and Baird speaks, "You're back. Good. I have already heard from an agent working on behalf of High Hegemon Daud. His revised terms are," the provost suppresses some emotion, "Small-minded."
Baird taps at her desk console, the light flickering in her spectacles. "I see that the hyperspace physics team has not reported completion of the six Gate scans."

[Line 5628] [Options Given: gaATG_talkToBairdNeedScans2:Continue]

[Line 5629] [Option Selected: Continue]
She turns to face you, "Without this data, we cannot tune the Janus prototype. Coordinate your efforts with Coureuse; get me those scans."
The provost terminates the commlink without letting you get a single word in.

[Line 5629] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]


------------------------------
Return to Baird with Daud deal and 6 scans
------------------------------
[Line 5631] Baird taps at her desk console. "With the Gate scans completed and Daud's assurance that the Hegemony will not interfere, we may proceed to the implementation phase."
The provost allows herself a small smile as she turns to you. "This is Scylla's moment, of course. Let me link her in."

[Line 5631] [Options Given: gaATG_janusPrototype0:Continue]

[Line 5632] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Provost Baird. Captain $playerName," Coureuse greets you. 
"Explain the Janus Device," Baird says, "For the captain here."

[Line 5632] [Options Given: gaATG_janusPrototype1:Continue]

[Line 5633] [Option Selected: Continue]
She looks nervous. "The prototype device," she begins, "Yes. In the um broad strokes, to scan for the Gate aperture, we direct a self-modifying phased hyperwave pulse which causes a resonation in lower dimensions which-" 
She looks up from the projected schematic and notices she's losing her audience. "Let's skip ahead to the application section." The schematics flicker through several labyrinthine arrangements and settle on an action flowchart. "Here we are."
"The principle of the Janus prototype is similar to the scanner, but far more energetic. By tuning the pulse to the unique resonant signature of a particular Gate aperture, one might - theoretically - activate that link. A second input would then target a known Gate egress, though avoiding destructive interference in the Calabi-Yau manifold is tricky..."

[Line 5633] [Options Given: gaATG_janusPrototype2:"So this would reopen the Gate network?"]

[Line 5634] [Option Selected: "So this would reopen the Gate network?"]
Baird cuts in, "Not exactly. Thank you for your attention to detail, Scylla, but if I may summarize: at this level of energy input, a temporary link should be created between two Gates."
The provost gets a distant look, "Then, with sufficient energy in stable resonance injected into the entire Gate system..."

[Line 5634] [Options Given: gaATG_janusPrototype3:Continue]

[Line 5635] [Option Selected: Continue]
This time, Coureuse interrupts, "But the data! It shows that the system, the resonance, it is fundamentally chaotic! There are clearly some other, some factors... we're seeing results the model doesn't account for, and at higher magnitudes the results could be, be-" She searches for words, some way to bind chaos and destruction into quantified language.
"That's enough, academician," Baird says forcefully. "The captain is a highly skilled professional and doesn't need to hear all of this to do their job."

[Line 5635] [Options Given: gaATG_janusPrototype4a:"Well..."
gaATG_janusPrototype4b:"The Provost is right, I am more of a big-picture type leader."
gaATG_janusPrototype4c:"Academician, what exactly does 'chaotic' mean in this context?"]

Baird turns to you, leaving Coureuse cowed, "Academician Coureuse will return to work refining the details as more data is gathered. As a great man once said, 'Technological advance is an inherently iterative process.'"
"Captain," she says, "The first prototype Janus Device is being transferred to your $shipOrFleet. Test it on a Gate manifold you have scanned. Record everything with your sensor suite and the modified instruments we have provided. This may be the most important experiment in the history of the Persean Sector."

[Line 5639] [Options Given: gaATG_janusPrototype5:"The... manifold. Of course."]

[Line 5640] [Option Selected: "The... manifold. Of course."]
Coureuse speaks up one last time, "Just, just don't use it in an inhabited system. Like the incident when Kallichore... the Hegemony... it wouldn't be good."
"Thank you," Baird says acidly, "For the reminder. Academician."
The provost turns to you now, "Obviously we shall not repeat my predecessor's mistake. Test this somewhere quiet." She turns from the holodisplay, a dismissal "I await your results, captain." 
Baird terminates the comms.

gaATG talk to Coureuse about Janus prototype after receiving it

[Line 5643] [Options Given: gaATG_askSCJanusPrototype1:"Should I be worried about this Janus prototype?"]

[Line 5644] [Option Selected: "Should I be worried about this Janus prototype?"]
Several emotions cross Coureuse's face all at once.
"Um. Captain. All science is..." She sighs, "No, I can't do this."

[Line 5644] [Options Given: gaATG_askSCJanusPrototype2:"What's going on?"]

[Line 5645] [Option Selected: "What's going on?"]
"Look. The provost told me what to tell you and not tell you. She was very clear about her objections to my... attitude. About questioning her leadership. And here I am, at the Galatia Academy. The Hegemony still has a warrant out for my arrest. To say nothing of the League, or, Ludd help me, the Pathers."

You activate your command interface and tap over to the Janus Device prototype controls. After a barely discernible pause, an alert appears.

The Gate awaits, as cold as a tomb.

[Line 5654] You hold your breath and lower your finger. Nothing happens. You look down at the splash of red text on your command interface.

[Line 5655] You know immediately that something is wrong. The hyperspace manifold display lights up with garish colors in violent whorls and jags, the representation's color-key glitching out on parameters beyond any anticipated scale. You hear a discordant tone - the hyperspace storm alarm, weirdly sounded here in normal space. 
And something else.
Echoing somewhere which exists only in your mind; like a wail of pain.
Your sensors officer shouts a warning, "Wavefront approaching!"

gaATG return after failed Janus test

[Line 5660] The station comms connect to the office of the provost with no delay and your navigation officer forwards the link to your command interface. She was waiting.
"Tell me what happened." Baird's tone is cold as vacuum. Coureuse is already on the link, looking paler than usual.
You get the distinct feeling that the provost knows very well what happened.

[Line 5661] [Option Selected: "There was some kind of accident."]
"Yes, an accident," Baird says with a derisive snort. "The prototype failed. Nearly catastrophically. A negative result, however dramatic, is still a useful data point... which can be used to correct our errors."

[Line 5662] [Option Selected: "You tell me what happened! I could have been killed by that thing!"]
"But you weren't. You're a survivor, captain, which is why you're ideal for this work. Besides," she says too-casually, "Making history is a dangerous career choice. The one you chose."

[Line 5663] [Option Selected: "I've seen worse. What's plan B?"]
Baird narrows her eyes at this. "Plan B is we recalibrate the device using the data you've gained from the experiment. Then we try again." 
Coureuse begins to speak, then thinks better of it. She looks ill at the thought.

[Line 5665] [Option Selected: Continue]
"I don't-" she starts, "We need more time."
"Academician-" Baird begins, a warning.
Coureuse interrupts, "I'm a theoretician, not an engineer! This isn't a matter of just fitting pipes or, or aligning agrav plates. What we're doing is completely new and, and our engineering process is primitive. We're scientists trying to assemble the equivalent of, of, of a new hyperdrive in a teaching workshop! Not only are the facilities insufficient, the project application falls outside my expertise!"

"It won't happen again," she says earnestly. "I promise."

[Line 5678] [Option Selected: "Yes, you definitely owe me for this."]
"I- I suppose I do, captain. I can't put all the blame on the provost. I did choose to follow her orders."

Gargoyle appears in a flash. "Scylla, girl! Where have you been? The goons won't let me into the lab anymore so I snuck in when they were changing shifts. Your bright but stylistically sedated friends told me you were in some kind of important meeting, so I thought, how important could it be if I wasn't invited? So I had to ask Alviss what was going on, can you believe it? You know how he is, all stammering and trying so so hard not to lie or say anything against the old witch, and-"
The hacker pauses, taking in Coureuse's demeanor - and yours. "Oh. This is about the experiment and the exploding, isn't it. Queen B wasn't happy about that, huh."

[Line 5681] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionStart8:"No, not especially."]

[Line 5682] [Option Selected: "No, not especially."]
"Yes," says Coureuse. "Um. I mean, no. She wasn't happy. But what's important now is that we find Elissa-"
"-Zal?" Gargoyle interrupts, looking pleased.
"I- yes. You know her?" Coureuse looks confused.

[Line 5682] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionStart9:Continue]

[Line 5683] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Oh yes, but please, please, I must apologize," Gargoyle says magnanimously, "I've interrupted your story. Go on, I don't want to spoil anything too soon." 
"Um," Coureuse recovers her composure, "Okay, yes, so I've... actually been in contact with Elissa off and on. Maybe uh, the captain here knows about that. The problem with Elissa is, well. She's being held sorta-prisoner by Kanta."
Gargoyle nods enthusiastically at this revelation.

[Line 5684] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionHubA:"Can you elaborate on 'sorta-prisoner?'"]

[Line 5685] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionHubB:"Kanta, as in the pirate warlord Kanta?"]

[Line 5686] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionHubC:"Gargoyle, I feel like you know something about what's going on."]

[Line 5687] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionHubC2:"What do you mean by 'another' Zal scheme?"]

[Line 5688] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionHubD:"How do we get Zal out?"]

[Line 5689] [Option Selected: "Can you elaborate on 'sorta-prisoner?'"]
"Well. She's allowed some contact with the outside world. Privileges? Um, obviously I guess, due to our ... arrangements. But that's all been through Kanta's organization, and then through whatever pirates owe the Kantas a favor. When Elissa says 'drop this instrument package in this orbit', if Kanta is behind her, it gets done."
"Elissa can sneak some things past Kanta's people. Her work is beyond them by a long shot," Coureuse smiles with pride at this, "But it's risky. And getting riskier. Kanta is a bit, um," she flutters her hands trying to figure out how to express it. "Her reactor is a bit leaky?"

[Line 5690] [Option Selected: "Kanta, as in the pirate warlord Kanta?"]
"Y-yes, that's the one. In the Magec system. This is, um, part of why I've been somewhat reluctant to bring it up. Elissa told me to keep it ... not secret exactly, but to be careful. Kanta has informers in many places. You know, blackmail, bribery, extortion. Anyone the Kantas can get their hands on, they'll use them. So you can never be sure who to trust."

[Line 5691] [Option Selected: "Gargoyle, I feel like you know something about what's going on."]
"Oh no no no," the hacker says, "But yes."
"A little, here and there. I mean, how could I not? Zal has a reputation. She's the Zal! It would be a delight to assist in another Zal scheme."
You can tell from the way Gargoyle says 'a reputation' that this is a sign of great respect from someone who does not respect easily.

[Line 5692] [Option Selected: "What do you mean by 'another' Zal scheme?"]
"Did I say that?" says Gargoyle, failing to look innocent.
"- Fine, yes. Another. Remember hacking the Aztlan relay?" The hacker puts on a wistful look, "Zal really pulled through for me on that job."

[Line 5693] [Option Selected: "How do we get Zal out?"]
"I can get you in," Gargoyle says deliberately, "You know, to talk. Find an angle. I think that might be how to do it. I may have worked with someone who - oh, twist my arm, yes it was Kanta's some, um," Gargoyle counts off a few fingers, "fourth cousin's grandnephew or something. There sure are a lot of Kantas, aren't there? Very busy, the Kantas."
"Point being, I may have acquired a digital token that'll get you an audience without getting shot on sight. From there, well, you also have a reputation! Tell Kanta you'll do some work for her. You're a hot item in the dark hypernet, what with everything you've been up to lately."

[Line 5693] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionHubD2:"Is 'hot' good?"]

[Line 5694] [Option Selected: "Is 'hot' good?"]
Gargoyle taps at something and your datapad chimes.
"Up to a point. There's hot, and there's radioactive. Right now, you're definitely hot. But you'll want to be careful about reaching critical mass."
"Yes, uh, we certainly don't want that," Coureuse adds. "But this is wonderful! If Gargoyle can give you a way in, then you can ... somehow get Elissa out? Maybe make a deal? I'll do whatever it takes. I don't have a lot of credits, but um, if it would help..."

[Line 5695] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionGotPlan:"So Kanta wants something found and returned. I could do that."]

[Line 5701] [Option Selected: "We're going to need a better plan than 'ask nicely'."]
"I've been keeping an ear out," says Gargoyle. "You know, keeping a finger on the pulse of the Sector. Basic responsibility as my role as a top-of-the-line security consultant. Standard stuff, really. Keeping the Hegemon out of the networks here only takes a few minutes a day. Clean the logs, update the firewalls, stir the ICE. I could do it in my sleep. A curious mind like mine needs stimulation, right?"

[Line 5701] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionBetterPlan2:"Sure. What's your point?"]

[Line 5702] [Option Selected: "Sure. What's your point?"]
"Kanta's really mad about something," Gargoyle explains. "Some gang of Pathers took something precious from her. She's putting out a call for the best mercs and captains."
"Maybe you'll answer it," the hacker says with a small smile.
Coureuse nods enthusiastically, "Yes, that could work. You'd be perfect!"

[Line 5703] [Option Selected: "Credits could help. How much are we talking about?"]
"I have savings of um, just under $gaATG_coureuseCredits credits," Coureuse says shyly.
You can see Gargoyle's head shake just slightly, saying that won't do it.

[Line 5703] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionCreditsKeep:"Keep your credits. We'll come up with something else."
gaATG_zalMissionCreditsTake:"Every credit helps. Send 'em over."]

[Line 5704] [Option Selected: "Every credit helps. Send 'em over."]
"Okay... okay good, transfer is complete," Coureuse says. "I'm just glad to be of help in some small way."
Gargoyle watches you, unmoving, with just a hint of a smile.

[Line 5706] [Option Selected: "Why not just shoot my way in and bust Zal out?"]
Gargoyle and Coureuse look skeptical.
"Isn't that, um." Coureuse looks pleadingly at Gargoyle, "Dangerous?"
The hacker raises an eyebrow, "A bold proposal, captain. A marine assault on the stronghold of a pirate warlord holed up in a former Hegemony military base notoriously surrounded by a stealth mine field and filled with the heavily armed scum and villainy of the Sector."
Gargoyle ponders the problem, implants flickering with blue-green light.

[Line 5706] [Options Given: gaATG_zalMissionShoot2:"Can you get me any kind of tactical advantage? Security codes?"]

[Line 5707] [Option Selected: "Can you get me any kind of tactical advantage? Security codes?"]
"Mmm. Absolutely," the hacker says with glib confidence. "It's not like they have a functioning civic bureaucracy to hack, so I'd have to make some contacts, throw some credits around... after a week or two of work I'd give you thirty-three repeating percent odds of-"
Coureuse interrupts suddenly, "We don't have time for that. Elissa is.. you can't... if you just shoot up the place, she might be-" she blinks away sudden tears, "Captain, there has to be some other way!"

[Line 5708] [Option Selected: "I'll just make it up as I go along. Intuition hasn't failed me yet."]
Both Gargoyle and Coureuse look confused for a moment. 
The hacker recovers first, and shrugs. "Best of luck. Be sure to comms if you need anything." 
The academician looks pensive in the face of this bonhomie. "I uh, thank you, captain. You won't regret helping Elissa, I know it."

[Line 5713] Kanta speaks again, raising a gauntleted arm for emphasis, "We know the family is safe so we will not take your blood. Not this day."
"Lucky you," the doctor whispers, smiling, then speaks louder, "The great Warlord is wondering, why would a thief dare show their face before mighty Kanta? The warlord makes an art of correcting those who hold the misguided belief that they may steal from her."
His spindly arm extends to indicate something piled in the dark around Kanta's throne; round shapes in the shadows, a glint of ivory.

A murmur in the pirates of the court. Doctor Cydonia looks quickly to Kanta to gauge how he should react. She is motionless, making only the sound of her life support machinery. 
He scurries up her throne to whisper and, presumably, listen. Satisfied after a short conference, the doctor stands forward to address you.
"The great warlord is intrigued, $playerName," Cydonia says, relishing the drama "She has heard your name before; her family is many and her subjugants watch from the shadows all across the sector. What do you bring to the feet of her warlordship?"
The mask-face of Kanta watches dispassionately.

Doctor Cydonia pulls back, shocked at your directness, and glances to Kanta to gauge how he should react. He scurries up her throne to whisper in her ear and listen. Satisfied after a short conference, the doctor stands forward to address you.
"The great warlord is intrigued by your knowledge of her queendom," Cydonia intones, relishing the drama. "When the outer family and the great Kanta's watchful subjugants from all across the sector whispered about the cleverness of the Captain $playerName, their words were no mere neutrino ghosts."

With a clank, Kanta herself stands, and her amplified voice drowns out Doctor Cydonia. "We see a predator, a hunter, a trickster, a warrior. We see a weapon. We would wield you."
The cowering Doctor Cydonia licks his lips and turns back to you, "Her ruthlessness would wield you," he admits, then addresses the court, "Glory and riches flow to those who the warlord so honors!"

[Line 5717] [Options Given: gaATG_kantaPaymentZal:"My payment will be Zal."]

[Line 5718] [Option Selected: "My payment will be Zal."]
Cydonia hunches forward, and speaks quietly, "Simply access? Or no- your demand is the whole of the person? Kanta went through much trouble to acquire that asset and is loath to give it up. But," his eyes twitch, accessing cybernetic implants, "We understand that your abilities are exceptional and you have access to, ahhh, high places. Special technologies. I may be able to convince Kanta to let you have the asset if you serve well, just-"
Kanta's voice booms out again, "Bring me back my pet Loke; then Zal is yours. Blood for blood. The Pather called Cotton will be taught Kanta's justice!"

Cydonia cringes at her demand and smiles apologetically as he steps back to address the court.

He leans close to you, smelling of vinegar.

Cydonia speaks quickly and quietly to you, eyes flickering with words and images only he can see. "Brother Livewell Cotton, a rising star of the Luddic Path. Based out of the planet Epiphany in the Al Gebbar system, generally. He could be many places however. One of his cells kidnapped Kanta's pet, a clone of the former warlord Onesimos Loke and my creation. She wants her pet back. No one else has managed to track Cotton down."
"She's," he frowns, hesitant to reveal something, then gives in. "She's obsessed. It's made things... difficult. Do this and you may relieve me of Zal as well, that, that meddling tinker."

Ignoring your words, Cydonia turns abruptly to the court and gives a shrill cry, "It is agreed! This captain will return the great warlord's pet-Loke! Watch now and be educated- this, this is how you serve the great warlord!"
Kanta claps once with her gauntlets, like an airlock slamming shut, and stands. Noise erupts from the court; Cydonia retreats to her side and guards step forward to lead you away.

As you are led away, a trembling, bruised man held by two power-armored goons makes pleading eye contact with you. His audience is next.
You are led back through the supplicants and courtiers. Shuffling figures gleaming crimson, chrome, and gold, many eyes fall upon you. You feel their hate as Kanta - or is it Cydonia? - wields you like a bludgeon to shame them.

You have an angle, at least, dubious though it may be: Brother Livewell Cotton. Epiphany. The clone of Onesimos Loke.
A pirate captain, tattooed with skulls and festooned with bandoleers shoves past you mumbling about boot-lickers. Your guards tense, but relax as the pirate and their entourage proceed. They're posturing, not looking for a fight. Despite Kanta - or Cydonia - poisoning your reputation with the pirates at-large, they won't dare stand in your way while you carry out the will of Warlord Kanta.

[Line 5731] [Option Selected: Prepare a raid to extract Elissa Zal]
You convene your senior officers to discuss an extraction scenario for Elissa Zal. Kanta's Den is swarming with heavily armed gangs and is enveloped by a stealth mine network. You also lack any real intel pertaining to Zal's position within the station. The potential cost and difficulty of the raid is therefore projected to be extreme. High attrition of assault shuttles must be assumed, and a dozen separate infiltration squads would have to simultaneously breach volumes where Zal could be held. 
There's no way the operation will be anything but a meat grinder. It would also be a blatant attack upon Kanta which would provoke pirates across the Sector, if that even matters anymore.

The raid hinges on mere minutes of chaos, all comms crackling with static and only tightbeam relays able to pierce the rain of EM scatter amidst clouds of chaff. Casualty reports roll in, displays in your bridge bleeding more and more red to fill the space with a bloody glow. In the confusion, more than one team reports success. This can be sorted out later- as quickly as they arrived, your forces perform an orderly withdrawal, though battered and depleted.

[Line 5733] Sporadic gunfire rattles through the corridors of Kanta's Den for a long time after your marines pull out.

[Line 5733] [Options Given: gaATG_kantaRaidFinished2:Continue]

[Line 5734] [Option Selected: Continue]
You meet a tired-looked Zal in an assault shuttle bay.
"I suppose I should thank you, captain," she says, wiping a thin dusting of carbon ash from her face.
"What a glorious wreck your invasion has made of everything. At least we saved the-" she looks sharply at a pair of marines hauling a sealed case behind her, "Careful with that! It's going to save us all."
Your adjutant interrupts, "Captain, we have a problem."

[Line 5734] [Options Given: gaATG_kantaRaidFinished3:"Report."]

[Line 5735] [Option Selected: "Report."]
You're filled in via comms as you rush back to the bridge.
Kanta's comms are still offline, but she seems to have independent control of the stealth mine system. Tactical reports an envelope of mines closing around your $shipOrFleet. Some are simple rocks with hidden warheads and neutral gas thrusters, others have been loitering in phase-space for Ludd-knows how long. There are more than PD can possibly handle.

[Line 5735] [Options Given: gaATG_kantaRaidFinished4:"Tactical, what are our options?"]

[Line 5736] Tactical sweats at your inquiry, "Sir-"
Zal appears behind you, held back by a couple guards. "Captain! Please listen- the stealth mines are on their own network. You have to get her to deactivate them."
She pauses for just a moment, then says "You have something Kanta values more than taking revenge on you. Or me."

[Line 5736] [Options Given: gaATG_returnLokeAirlock1a:"Security- toss the Loke clone out an airlock. With a helmet."
gaATG_returnLokeAirlock1b:"Security- toss the Loke clone out an airlock."]

[Line 5737] "Sir," your officer says, "Ah-"
Zal appears behind you, held back by a couple guards. "Captain! Please listen- Kanta had me working on a new generation of the stealth mines. I've got the codes to blow them, which might give us a chance."
"Just let me access a wide-array comms station and I'll do it."

[Line 5737] [Options Given: gaATG_kantaRaidFinished4b2:"Do it."]

[Line 5738] [Option Selected: "Do it."]
Zal shoves aside your comms officer, who looks only somewhat offended, and starts furiously tapping at the controls. Within moments, a careless handful of novas blink across the tactical display.
"I hate how the interface whites out when that happens," your tactical officer grumbles, then reports "Captain, the stealth mines are cleared enough for us to disengage."

[Line 5742] [Option Selected: Inform the pirate that you are working for the Warlord Kanta]
You hold up your hand, interrupting the pirate captain mid-threat. This seems to catch $himOrHer off guard.
You use the moment to calmly explain that you have personally been given a mission by Warlord Kanta to return her pet Loke-clone to her. It would be in their best interests if they did everything possible to facilitate the success of your mission. Imagine what Kanta would think if she heard you had been distracted from carrying out her will.

[Line 5742] [Options Given: gaVIP_informPirate2:Continue]

[Line 5743] [Option Selected: Continue]
The pirate looks as though $heOrShe has been struck by a Tachyon Lance. 
"Y-yes, captain. Of course." $HeOrShe struggles to regain $hisOrHer composure, "Please, accept my profound apologies, profoundly, for the delay. I welcome you to be on your way and g-give my best regards to the Warlord."
You snap the comms link off while the pirate is still attempting an awkward half-bow.

]

[Line 5747] [Option Selected: Tell Baird that your plan to meet Warlord Kanta]
As you speak, Baird doesn't look tremendously impressed by Coureuse and Gargoyle's plan.
"Stupid. But bold, I admit," the provost says finally. "Sometimes the direct route is the best. Like Alexander at Telmessos, yes? Just don't start too many fires on the way, please. You will soon be needed for important work; real work. I don't want you starting some kind of war when we're so close to the culmination of all I've been working toward."

[Line 5748] [Options Given: gaATG_tellBairdAboutFindingLoke2:Tell Baird about the mission you are doing for Warlord Kanta]

[Line 5749] [Option Selected: Tell Baird about the mission you are doing for Warlord Kanta]
The provost looks perplexed. "Kanta made a clone of the Warlord Loke, the very man to whom she once swore fealty? How perverse."
Baird dismisses this with a wave. "As a rule, I don't find it productive to dwell upon the psychology of insane pirates. Do it, or don't. Above all be on guard. The so-called Warlord Kanta achieved her place in the world through treachery and brutality in equal measure. I doubt she's changed her habits."
Provost Baird stares out her office window, over the academy interior. "The future we're building will have little place for her kind."

raid Epiphany for Loke
------------------------------
[Line 5756] [Options Given: 2:gaATG_cottonRaidStart:Prepare a raid to extract Clone Loke]

[Line 5757] [Option Selected: Prepare a raid to extract Clone Loke]
You convene your senior officers to discuss the option of seizing the Loke clone from Brother Cotton's forces. SIGINT is spotty due to Pathers' low-tech operations and HUMINT nearly impossible due to their fanaticism. Nonetheless, your officers have identified several possible fortified compounds connected with Cotton's sect. 
Any attack on Cotton will be viewed by Pathers as an attack on all. Once the shooting starts you anticipate security forces to activate planet-wide, so this has to be a quick operation. Hitting Cotton's strongholds all at once in a surprise raid will require many marines squads, but it will ensure the greatest odds of finding the Loke clone.

[Line 5757] [Options Given: mktRaidNonMarket:Continue]

[Line 5758] The main bridge is a hive of activity, with additional officers brought in to coordinate the assaults by tactical teams on the strongholds of Cotton's Pathers. A volley of quick orbital strikes from your $shipOrFleet disrupt power and communications, leaving planetside comms-chatter a confused staticky buzz of automated alerts and hand-equipment operators speaking in code.
Your part is simple now: let the marines do their work while you provide orbital cover for the extraction shuttles.
Displays flicker with vidfeed, a live order-of-battle chart ticks off nodes as casualties tick up. You watch, and wait for your raiders to return.

[Line 5759] You meet the successful extraction team in the shuttle bay. The smell of vacuum and combat fills your nose: burnt, acrid, and metallic.

[Line 5759] [Options Given: gaATG_cottonRaidFinished2:Continue]

[Line 5760] [Option Selected: Continue]
A couple marines in power armor undersuits escort Clone Loke into your custody. He looks around curiously. Seeing you, he stops, makes a bland, lopsided smile, and says "Ludd blesses you, friend."
You have him escorted to the brig for safekeeping.
Your personal comms starts buzzing; scattered planetary defenses are starting to activate. Tactical reports a tentative radar sweep from some kind of ground battery.

[Line 5760] [Options Given: gaATG_cottonRaidFinished3:"Nav, get us out of here."]

[Line 5774] [Option Selected: "I need to find someone kidnapped by Brother Cotton."]
$HeOrShe gives you a hard look.
"The Luddic Path, you say. 'May be involved'? Look, I can see where you're going and I don't believe it is a good idea."
$personLastName sighs. "The security forces are occupied with hunting the most extreme militants already and, say what you will, but they have a... sense of professionalism about it. They know to respect most of us Faithful. Usually."

[Line 5774] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5775] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for someone who is a... guest of Brother Cotton."]
$personLastName raises an eyebrow. "Begging sweet Ludd's forgiveness, spacer, but if I did know such a good man, I would be wary of letting his name escape my lips too easily."
"Condemn not the ignorant for they know not their error, as the book says, but Grace of the Path, protect me - and you - from inquiries best not made lest a terrible swift hammer full upon us." $HeOrShe smiles nervously.
"Let us speak of other things," $heOrShe says. "The weather! Unpleasant lately, no?"

[Line 5776] [Option Selected: "I'm looking for someone who is a... guest of Brother Cotton."]
$personLastName raises an eyebrow. "Begging sweet Ludd's forgiveness, my fellow $playerBrotherOrSister, but if I did know such a good man, I would be wary of letting his name escape my lips too easily."
"But we're all pilgrims of the faith here, are we not?" $HeOrShe lets the hint of a smile appear, enjoying the chance to tease at hidden knowledge. "A pilgrim like you should visit a more worldly shrine. Come down port-side. There is a teahouse where the outworlders and Mammonites gather. There you will find your answer."
The spacer bar, in other words. As much as a teahouse-speakeasy can pass for a decent bar in this place.

gaATG_epiphanyAskCottonDecline:"Perhaps our paths should not cross just yet."]

[Line 5777] [Option Selected: "I'll pay you good credits to know where to find Brother Cotton."]
"Ah ha-ha," $heOrShe laughs nervously. "Would that I could help you, friend, would that I could help you. Alas, I have no notion of such a thing and besides, what need have I for credits when devotion to the Creator nourishes my soul and keeps me tight to the Path?"
"I shall surely pray for you, captain, that the hammer, when it comes, falls softly," $heOrShe says. "Would you look at the hour? I must adjourn to see to my prayers. Until our paths cross again, blessings upon you."
$HeOrShe cuts the comm link on you somewhat abruptly, leaving you with a staticky holding pattern.

[Line 5777] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 5778] [Option Selected: "I wish to speak with Brother Cotton. Can you help?"]
$Post $personLastName looks at you carefully before responding.
"I might recall hearing of a man by this name once. I would not know where he would be, or what he has done of late. And if I did, I would not tell. But if I were to leave a message with a friend who may have a friend who might be that man..."
$HeOrShe looks up to the stars and sighs. "It is not my Path to judge what business you might have, begging all the forgiveness of Providence."

[Line 5778] [Options Given: gaATG_epiphanyAskCotton2:"Are you offering to arrange a meeting?"]

[Line 5779] [Option Selected: "Are you offering to arrange a meeting?"]
"Might be," $heOrShe says nervously. "Come down port-side. There's a teahouse where the outworlders gather, where the guardians of virtue watch vigilantly for the influence of Moloch and Mammon."
The spacer bar, in other words. As much as a teahouse-speakeasy can pass for a decent bar in this place.

Epiphany ask around bar
------------------------------
[Line 5786] You begin with the time-honored conversation-starter of buying strangers a round 'to celebrate a good haul'. 
It is a hard sell here; off-worlders drink their vices furtively to maintain a thin veneer of Luddic deniability. You focus instead on the unbelieving Epiphany natives who regularly work with starfarers. Casually inquiring about import-export business opportunities, understood by all to be a roundabout pitch for a smuggling job, you ask, by the way, have you heard of a 'Brother Cotton'?
Invoking this name kills conversations like an EMP. One table mumbles excuses and leaves their untouched drinks, fearful that you're an informer, an enormous fool, or both.

[Line 5786] [Options Given: gaATG_epiphanyBar1:Continue]

[Line 5787] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Watch yourself, speaking that name," one old ore-pusher tells you, taking a long draw from your gifted drink. "I know folk who crossed him and they ended up dead. He's got eyes and ears everywhere. Clever enough to bend the tech-bans to his advantage, ya'know. Most true believers? Cowards pulling a con or got their brains adrift - not him though, no; he's made the Path his own and knows how to use it."
"Welp," he finishes the drink with one long gulp, "This'll be you then," and scuttles off just as a trio of burly thugs in mining guild uniforms approach.

[Line 5787] [Options Given: gaATG_epiphanyBarA1:"Evening, friends. Next round on me?"

[Line 5788] [Option Selected: "Evening, friends. Next round on me?"]
"We reject the gilt bribery of Mammon," says one of the heavies, spitting at your feet. The others look similarly uninterested in your offer. 
"What's our brother's good name doing in the mouth of this heretic?" the first one says to the others, "Might be we have to remove it ourselves."

"Speak not the prophet's name, unbeliever," the thug on the right hisses.

[Line 5791] [Option Selected: Simply nod to your guards;['gaATG_epiphanyBarPeace1']]
One of the heavies puts an arm out to stop you, prompting your guards - unobtrusively hovering in the shadows - to step forward, ready to draw weapons.
The moment seems to freeze- the proprietor stops polishing a glass, the conversation two tables over goes quiet, and fearful eyes all turn toward the confrontation.

[Line 5792] [Options Given: gaATG_epiphanyBarTalk1a:"I meant no offense. I just wish to see your boss."]

[Line 5793] [Options Given: gaATG_epiphanyBarTalk1b:"Mind yourself- I can have this place razed from orbit with a word."]

[Line 5797] [Option Selected: Stare him down;['gaATG_epiphanyBarTalk1a'];['gaATG_epiphanyBarTalk1b']]
The lead heavy's resolve wavers, and he turns to his left. The backup pulls out a chunky device, a handmade comms unit, and mumbles a query. It emits a scratchy, distorted response. 
Whatever was said, it must have been good news. The heavies visibly relax and the leader, now more suspicious than hostile, says "Brother Cotton would parlay. Be here to meet. After next shift."

gaATG_epiphanyBarEndWait2b:"Server, a round for the large gentlemen over there!"]

You station yourself in a nice, solid corner; back to the wall, good sightlines to exits. Your guards unobtrusively follow suit.
The tea arrives shortly and the server makes no smalltalk, eager to not give the impression that they have any association with you.

[Line 5799] [Options Given: gaATG_epiphanyBarEndWait3:Wait]

[Line 5800] [Option Selected: "Server, a round for the large gentlemen over there!"]
You buy a round for the Pather heavies and they eye you as they order something else, leaving your gifts untouched.
You station yourself in a nice, solid corner; back to the wall, good sightlines to exits. Your guards unobtrusively follow suit.

[Line 5800] [Options Given: gaATG_epiphanyBarEndWait3:Wait]

[Line 5801] [Option Selected: Wait]
You note the change of shift as chronometers and tastefully obsolete datapads notify the working regulars - miners and spacer crew, mostly - to finish their drinks and stumble off to their assignments.
The proprietor sets down a bottle and approaches you. "Hear me, I beg," she says. "I've nothing to do with him or his. You... you can't refuse them here, captain."
She glances toward the table with the heavies. They're watching you both, very closely. "I was told- the back room. He's waiting now. I- I saw nothing today."

gaATG_meetCottonAvoid:Don't go to the back room]

[Line 5807] [Option Selected: Go to the back room]
The private room is austere, dim but for the spot of a paper lantern cast on the figure sitting facing you. He raises his face as you enter and holds a hand out to welcome you to sit. The sparse decor and furniture have the solid hand-made quality of true Luddic crafts and you know the set could be sold for a good price on any number of the core worlds.

[Line 5808] Brother Livewell Cotton stands and smiles as you enter. "Captain $playerName," he says, "It was my pleasure to hear that our paths would cross again."
He gives you a knowing look, "I pray you have meditated upon our previous discussion."

[Line 5809] "Captain $playerName. I am Brother Livewell Cotton and I'm pleased to greet you. With the blessings of Ludd's peace and all that, naturally." He winks and offers a hand.

His smile widens slightly as you shake his hand, "A pleasure. Call me Livewell if you like, and I'll thank you for the sentiment."

[Line 5811] [Option Selected: Don't shake his hand]
He maintains his smile. "As you'll do. Whatever blood's between us, it never hurt anyone to be kind in a small way." He points with his untaken hand "Ludd said that last bit once, you know, blessings be."
Then he brings his hands together, an unconscious return to prayer.

[Line 5812] "Won't you join me for tea? I offer it to you, my guest, with the safety and hospitality that I've been blessed to provide."
He notes your hesitation and sits first. "Come along in your own time. I'm no scorpion, I do assure you."

He grins, "Then I shall content myself with the cheer of your face."

You sit with Brother Cotton, notorious Pather terrorist.

[Line 5816] Option(s) Selected: ['gaATG_meetCottonTeaStand'];['gaATG_meetCottonTeaNever']
Cotton arranges two plain cups, and tests the temperature of the teapot.
"Now I do know why you are here. It's no great coup of the secret-whisperers-and-listeners why the warlord Jorien Kanta has been sending a most diverse company of ne'er-do-wells to bring myself to an untimely end and, be it convenient, claim back her ungodly creation."

[Line 5827] [Option Selected: "Did you not send a rogue Luddic Knight to kill me?"]
"Indeed I did so," he nods, as this is a mere philosophical point. "And now here you are, your path brought together with mine. The means of Blessed Providence seem so mercurial to the eyes of us mortals, do they not?"

[Line 5827] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonKnightExplanation:"I want an explanation."

"Indeed," Cotton says, drawing out the word, his tone carefully controlled. "I will pray upon the meaning of your words, captain. This I promise."

[Line 5830] [Option Selected: "Is that offer open?"]
"Indeed," Cotton says, drawing out the word, his tone carefully controlled. "Mind you, it is not mine to give as-such; absolution is for all humanity who do so chose."

He leans back, meeting your eyes, as if he believes it important to face someone whose death he ordered.
"You did appear then to be an enemy of our righteous cause. In war, we battle our enemies. That is all. I did not then fully understand your significance, which... was revealed to me only recently."

[Line 5832] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonKnight3:"And what significance is that?"]

[Line 5833] [Option Selected: "And what significance is that?"]
He pauses, looking almost shy for a moment, then says "That... we will speak of that before we are done here."

[Line 5834] [Option Selected: "Despite hired killers coming for you, you meet me with tea. Why?"]
"Tell true, if I met you with hammer and fiery sword, would you prevail?" Cotton nods generously, "Might be you do. Then what would my brothers and sisters have died for? The clone?"
He takes a moment to sip his tea, and finding it hot, blows on the cup.
"It serves our holy war that Kanta not forget that the Path is all around her, ephemeral and indomitable. Killing is not victory." He smiles wryly, "Not always."

[Line 5835] [Option Selected: "This seems uncharacteristically non-violent."]
Cotton sets his tea down, smile gone.
"I confess to you that I did not always seek victory over killing. Given battle, I chose to destroy my enemy over defeating them. In time, Ludd's spirit showed me the true Path. I humbly submit and step away from that younger man's rage when it serves our holy war."

[Line 5835] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonTeaWar:Continue]

[Line 5836] [Option Selected: "Did you realize that you cannot best me in combat?"]
Cotton raises an eyebrow at this challenge and sets his tea down with a sad smile. 
"A younger man than I once was thought he might nourish his soul if only he could kill every heretic that stood before him."
"What he found was not strength, but pride. And he- he would have killed you before you had spoken those words. On the landing pad, perhaps; a bomb in a cargo container. Or on the street, with his hands, had it come to it. That man was as blind as his enemies."

[Line 5836] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonTeaWar:Continue]

[Line 5837] [Option Selected: "I suppose you have better things for them to die for?"]
"Yes." Cotton sets his tea down, eyes hard.
"Yes I do. I did not don the blood-stained mantle of leadership lightly. It was to be my Path. And I shall walk without averting my eyes from the truth of my deeds. Ludd's revelation is pain!" He slams a hand on the table, rattling the dishware. "Ludd chose the Path not because it was easy, or kind, or without suffering!"
He speaks in almost a whisper, "The prophet chose because it was Good."

[Line 5837] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonTeaWar:Continue]

[Line 5838] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Hegemony tacticians and the thinking machines alike make the same mistake: they think that we who walk the Path can be defeated if we are measured, tracked, and numbered. Our beautiful holy war is not a mathematical calculation, but the soul of humanity. What we fight for cannot be held in databanks and logbooks."
He looks at you carefully. "I am certain that now is not our time to do battle," he says. "We walk a path, you and I, and here it crosses but does not end. I know not but that I must have faith."
He sips his tea. "It's good now. You should have some."

[Line 5839] [Option Selected: "What do you even want with the Loke clone, if he's so ungodly?"]
"You know the histories, of the great and terrible Warlord Onesimos Loke, yes? Once a grand officer of the Domain..." Cotton looks distant, "The Knights of Ludd stood then with the Hegemony. Standing with Pride against Wrath. Was that the Path?"
"This abomination is a sad copy of Onesimos Loke concocted by so-called 'doctor' Cydonia. He is a sick man, and to please Kanta for reasons I do not understand, he made a sick joke of the miracle of life."

[Line 5840] [Option Selected: "So what are you going to do with the clone?"]
"I had thought its death would be a demonstration, just as a healer excises a cancer. But as I held a gun to its head, my hand was stayed. I felt this was not the Path. Did I pity the thing? It is rare indeed that I do not find moral clarity in the execution of a heretic or abomination." 
Cotton shakes his head, disturbed that he did not want to execute a man.
"I gave it into the care of some siblings of the faith. They taught it prayer from the Book. It appears to think, and to feel. I wonder if this is a lesson in humility. Imagine, to look upon the Creator's work and then this bloodless thing..."

[Line 5841] [Option Selected: "Kanta didn't explicitly ask me to kill you. Nor did Cydonia."]
"Yes, yes. Cydonia. Some mercy. You have met him, I know. Is he not strange? I cannot imagine a more wretched creature - excepting his creation, the Loke-thing. Cydonia is a liar to the end of space, and even the sacred becomes sin when it has left his hands."
"If you find occasion to bring his life to an end, I do believe it would be a good and righteous deed." 
Cotton sips tea.

[Line 5841] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonCydonia2:"And Kanta?"]

[Line 5842] [Option Selected: "And Kanta?"]
"If the Loke-thing started less than human, Kanta has lowered herself to that sorry state by her debauched pursuit of wrath and immortality."
Brother Cotton takes another slow sip of tea, "She is a malfunction of the machinery of the Hegemony; an obsolete hazard to be cleared away like the stealth-mines she's wrapped around her fortress."

[Line 5843] [Option Selected: "Why is this clone so important to Kanta?"]
"What now sits on Kanta's throne of blood and gold is abject to the teachings of blessed Ludd," he taps his fingers on his teacup. "Though a warrior cannot be ignorant of his enemies, I confess that I am not inclined to gaze too deeply into that monstrous abyss. Shall I debate an AI core, shall I ponder its heart? No, because it has no heart, no soul. It is a thing."
"Kanta wants her abomination. This is all I need to know." Cotton meets your eyes, "And you will be the one to give the abomination back to her."

[Line 5844] [Option Selected: "You're just going to give me Loke?"]
"Yes," he says, his eyes unblinking. "It has no path here. Its presence is raising questions which ought not be asked. So you will take it from my people and go."

[Line 5844] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonExpected:"This is unexpected."]

[Line 5845] [Option Selected: "I wish to take the Loke clone back to Kanta. As I agreed."]
Brother Livewell Cotton nods, and to your surprise simply says, "Then you shall."

[Line 5845] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonExpected:"This is unexpected."]

[Line 5846] [Option Selected: "I'm taking the Loke clone."]
Brother Cotton nods in agreement, and to your surprise says "You are indeed."

[Line 5847] [Option Selected: "This is unexpected."]
"By both of us, I tell you true."
"I have prayed long on this matter," he says, bringing his hands together as if in demonstration. "Once, long ago, I was in a prison cell. I heard a music like... like the holy pneuma, from afar. A choir of angels."
"My heart leapt, to be touched so. Eagerly, I listened closer and in not a blink it was gone. For just a moment I was touched by grace. Do you understand? My life turned on that point; I found the Path."

[Line 5847] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonEnd1:Continue]

[Line 5848] [Option Selected: Continue]
"The music did not return. So that was my one moment, I thought. It had confirmed my righteous calling, and that was enough. For years I 'heard' nothing. I expected nothing." 
"Then, one day not too long ago," he speaks haltingly, looking troubled. "It, it did visit upon me again." 
His voice is soft now, "That was the day I was told you were to come here. What am I to make of that?"

[Line 5848] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonEnd2:Continue]

[Line 5849] [Option Selected: Continue]
Brother Cotton stands, "I cannot say whether it is a choir of angels or a host of demons," he says. "I fear not pain, death, or judgment. But I do fear to stray from the Path."
He adjusts his coat; one of his minions opens the door, and the clink and murmur of the teahouse returns.
"My people have already brought the abomination to your shuttle," and as if on cue you feel an urgent buzz from your comms.
"Go there now, with Ludd's peace," he says.

[Line 5849] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonEnd3:Leave]

[Line 5850] [Option Selected: Leave]
Once outside the teahouse, you duck into a dark corner where the local vice squad is unlikely to spot you engaging in flagrant use of technology. You confirm via comms that the clone Loke has indeed been handed over to your waiting shuttle crew.
You return to your shuttle, and get the full but short story from your nervous guards: a squad of Pathers appeared, shoved a strange man into their hands, then left.

[Line 5850] [Options Given: gaATG_meetCottonEnd4:Enter the shuttle]

[Line 5851] [Option Selected: Enter the shuttle]
Inside, a couple confused-looking marines are watching clone Loke eat a simple meal of space rations wrapped in foil. 
As you approach, Loke looks at you curiously, dropping the foil packet. With a bland smile he says "Ludd blesses you. Together we will walk on the Path."
You tell the marines to let him finish his lunch before escorting him to the brig for safekeeping.

gaATG_meetCottonEndAskLokeC:"Loke, do you want to be free?"]

[Line 5852] [Option Selected: "Loke, do you want to go back to Kanta?"]
Loke smiles, some green thing from the ration still stuck in his teeth.
"Yes. I will go to Jorien," he says excitedly. "I will tell her about the Path! She will like it."

[Line 5853] [Option Selected: "Loke, do you want to stay here?"]
Loke looks around, pausing a moment to take in the dusty blast-shields of the landing bay through a window. "No," he says. "It's cold."

[Line 5854] [Option Selected: "Loke, do you want to be free?"]
"I..." Loke's brow wrinkles around the grotesque scar on his forehead. "I... want...." 
He bites his own lip, and cries out in pain. Anger rises on his face and he stomps the foil wrapper he dropped, as if to punish the thing.
The moment passes, and slowly his breathing returns to normal. His eyes wander over the ground, then back to you. "We will go to space now?" he asks.

Return to Kanta with Loke
------------------------------
[Line 5857] Your nav officer calls your attention to the bridge display of the local volume; what passes for traffic control around Kanta's Den appears to be non-operational. A comms request blinks suddenly.
Warlord Kanta appears, a masked face atop a throne draped with the trophies of raids and conquest. 

[Line 5857] [Options Given: gaATG_returnLokeStart2:Continue]

[Line 5858] [Option Selected: Continue]
Beside her, of course, is 'doctor' Cydonia, who begins to speak. "Ah, so captain, do-" 
"Do you return our dear Loke?" Kanta booms over him.

[Line 5858] [Options Given: gaATG_returnLokeFirst:"Yes. A shuttle will take him stationside."
gaATG_returnLokeNowZal1:"I have Loke for you. But first, I want Zal."

[Line 5859] [Option Selected: "Yes. A shuttle will take him stationside."]
Kanta breaks into a titanium smile. 
"Good, good," says Cydonia, rushing to get a word in. "The warlord is much pleased with your work."

[Line 5859] [Options Given: gaATG_returnLokeNowZal1:"Now send me Zal."]

[Line 5860] [Option Selected: "Now send me Zal."]
Kanta laughs inhumanly.
"Ah," says the doctor, licking his lips. "I'm afraid it isn't quite so simple as that. You've not pleased the great warlord Kanta sufficiently for her to simply give you her prize tinker."

[Line 5860] [Options Given: gaATG_returnLokeBetrayal1:"What is it you want, then?"

[Line 5863] [Option Selected: "You call yourself warlord? You're a small-time cheat and liar.";['gaATG_returnLokeBetrayal1'];['gaATG_returnLokeBetrayal2']]
Tactical whispers in your ear, "Captain, detected stealth mines arming. Sparse envelopment of $shipOrFleet. Damage outlook - checking - moderate. They want to show they can hit us."
Kanta's voice rolls from the comms, "Kanta wields, and it is Kanta who orders. If... we give you a gift, it will be only at our pleasure. You must learn."
"Yes, yes," Cydonia agrees, "You must learn. Kanta has for you another task: complete it without complaint then perhaps you may win back her favor... after, after such an outrageous-"

Zal joins the line, interrupting Cydonia.
"-I've decided to take Captain $playerName up on that deal," Zal says. Her voice sounds close, as if she is speaking from inside a vacsuit. "Captain, I'm outside your flagship now if you would please open the bay doors."
Shock washes over Cydonia, "Impossible!" he says, and turns to some minion, "Check Zal's quarters! Now!"

[Line 5864] [Options Given: gaATG_returnLokeZalShows2:Continue]

Zal's image flickers, then holds steady. 
"I took the liberty of injecting one of Gargoyle's tricks into their network." She smirks. "Would you mind letting me on board? It won't take them long to get a signal out. This volume is going to be swarming with pirates very soon, to say nothing of the stealth mine network."

[Line 5866] [Options Given: gaATG_returnLokeZal3:"Open the pod bay doors, ops."]

[Line 5867] [Option Selected: "Open the pod bay doors, ops."]
After a tense minute, security reports that they've brought Zal aboard - along with a large equipment case. At your orders, your security chief provides her with a ship's comm unit.
"I owe you one," Zal says, "And I think I can repay you shortly. But first you're going to want to get out of the stealth mine network."
"I think you have something Kanta values more than taking revenge on you. Or me."

Zal speaks up, "Kanta will call her fleets. They usually loiter in nearby hyperspace. They'll come through the jump-points, then straight for us."

Zal uses Janus device with Magec Gate
------------------------------
[Line 5879] Before you hangs the Gate, the vast and potent derelict of a former age.

[Line 5881] You have scanned this Gate and discovered the rhythm of the secret heart of the thing, hidden in a slip of space.

"On it," she says.
It takes mere minutes before your chief engineer reports that integration of the Janus Device into your hyperdrive system is complete.

"Then," Zal says, "I give you my working Janus Device. I can hook it up to your flagship's hyperdrive. Then we can travel through the Gates to the Galatia system."

"We'll see," Zal says.

[Line 5893] [Option Selected: "Scylla will be glad to see you."]
"Yeah," Zal says, "It's- let's just focus on getting through this alive."

[Line 5895] [Option Selected: "Zal, how do I know it isn't going to explode on me again?"]
"Captain," Zal says, "I'll try to be brief. First: Scylla was sending me the Galatia Academy's schematics and experimental data all along. Including the results of the failed prototype test."
"Second: The Academy didn't have access to my, I'll admit, considerable and unique skills. And Kanta- those pirates can buy, cheat, and steal some fine gear on short notice."
"Third, and I'm not going to apologize, but Scylla and I held back the working device. It was my idea for leverage over Baird."

She hesitates, then says "With my life."

[Line 5897] [Option Selected: "Great plan. You almost blew me up before."]
"You didn't though," she says impatiently, "Let's focus on the present crisis. You've got the Gate there in front of you. Use it."

[Line 5898] [Option Selected: "We have a lot to talk about."]
"There will be time for that later," she says impatiently. "If this doesn't work, captain, then Scylla and I have been wrong about everything. I trust her." 
She hesitates, then says "With my life."

[Line 5899] [Option Selected: Scan the Gate]
Your command display shows the hyperspace manifold. It is calm and cool.
The scan begins, a line of disruption flaring between your flagship and the Gate. Spirals and ripples spill and surge in non-Newtonian bursts from a point at the center of the Gate. No, not a point - a circle, a sphere, a torus and inverted funnel; then some geometry that does not parse. You hear the faint music.
"Captain," your sensors officer reports, "The scan is complete."

[Line 5900] [Option Selected: "Nav, activate the Janus Device and take us in."]
The hyperspace manifold pulses coolly, then again, warmer. It is working. Your officers operate with collective cool, but you can feel their tension. You are about to do what no one has done for over two hundred cycles.
A distant keening touches your mind. You instantly review your command status displays: no hyperspace alarm, no system alerts; no one else reacts as if anything is wrong. It's just in your head. An animal in pain; you try to concentrate on the sound and it slips away.
You hear the thrum of life support, the rumble of engines, the soft chorus of the bridge consoles' feedback and your officers' humanity. Everyone is watching the pulsing of the Gate.

[Line 5904] "Captain $playerName," Baird says. "We observed your $shipOrFleet come through the Gate."
"It was magnificent." She takes a deep breath, looking up and away for a moment, then back to you. "History has leapt forward for the first time in two hundred cycles."
"Scylla," the provost says suddenly, "She should hear this so she knows why I had to do all that I did. I'll link her in."

Coureuse joins the call, alert and expectant. 
"Captain!" she says, "And uh, provost. We've all been watching the feeds and- I've been in contact with Elissa. Thank you, thank you captain."
The provost raises an eyebrow. Prompted, Coureuse explains "Elissa built a working Janus device and gave it to the captain. She's brought us the full schematics."
"I should like to meet this Elissa Zal," the provost says evenly.

"Elissa Zal," Baird says. You can almost feel her judging through the comm-link. "This is all very... surprising," she says, off balance. "Academician Coureuse. Zal. We have much to discuss, but first get those schematics to the hyperspace labs."
"And captain," the provost addresses you now, "If you would come directly to my office. We ought not discuss details of the next stage on comms."

You enter Provost Baird's office and she greets you with uncharacteristic warmth.
"Come in, come in. Make yourself comfortable," she says. You note a bottle of something rare and four crystal glasses on her desk.
She taps at her console interface, "I wanted to show you this before the announcement went public. With," she adds with sarcastic reverence, "approval from the High Hegemon."
With a flicker, the holoprojector beams an image into the large central volume of the office: your flagship triumphantly exiting a Gate, drive aglow, hyperspace bubble rendered in visible EM as a victorious golden aura.

"And this little show is only the first step, captain. A link between two Gates is momentous, but it means that so much more is possible: if we can open one Gate, then we can scale the technology to open more. It will take nearly unimaginable energy - and the resources of a Sector-spanning empire."
Baird brings her hands together, staring at the holo, and taps her fingers as if to let off excess energy. "Though the factions of this Sector are weak, the bones of the Domain are scattered all around us. Academician Simisola has located a derelict coronal tap which could provide the energy required to - theoretically, mind - open permanent links in the Gate network. And if what Coureuse's theories imply are true..." 
The provost's attention returns to the world around her. "Where is Scylla? She was to report here after securing the schematics."

She taps a key on her desk-console, a touch of annoyance in her voice "Sebestyen. Have Coureuse and- yes, and Zal. Have them sent in." She shakes her head and gives you a see-what-we-must-deal-with look.
As she turns away, the comms unit chimes. She turns back, "What is it, Alviss? ... Is she on the station or not? Stop stammering, it's a simple yes or no question. ... I see."

With Baird's attention thoroughly, and increasingly furiously, focused elsewhere, you pour yourself a glass, sample the fumes, and sip. Some kind of brandy. Eventide, judging by the label - a stylized arc of solar mirrors over a celestial orb.
A fine vintage; subtle, powerful, unexpected. You're beginning to suspect that this might be the highlight of the rest of this day.

Gargoyle's face appears, projected over the expansive desk. "Where are they," Baird demands, "By Ludd's seven hells I will sell you piece by piece to Tri-Tach if you lie to me."
The hacker goes very still. Staring at the hissing crack in a bulkhead threatening to collapse into vacuum. "I do not know," Gargoyle says deliberately. "I did not assist them in... in some scheme. Though perhaps I did, though they never said it was their intention. I simply... provided tools they requested. Codes, programs. Advice."
"So you helped them!" Baird shouts. "For the protection I provided, asking the High Hegemon himself to overlook your crimes, you repay me with this treachery?"

Another finger, "Her: credits, legitimacy, and if not forgiveness then a clear head about the value of an asset despite personal feelings about said asset."
"I'll be fine," Gargoyle says, waving a hand dismissively. "I must say though, I am touched that you're so concerned about my well-being."

Academician Alviss Sebestyen

[Line 5963] The comms connect after a moment.
"Oh, hello, it's you!" Your contact almost looks surprised that you're calling, but manages to launch into an upbeat introduction.
"My name is Alviss Sebestyen. The new provost - that is, Provost Baird - assigned me to be your liaison with the academy. I hope you're as excited to work with me as I am to be working with you!"

"Right, yes, um." He seems nervous to be meeting a real-life space captain. You wonder idly how he even got this position. 
"...different departments within the Galatia Academy tell me what they need done, then I coordinate with freelancers like yourself to procure, uh, the necessary services. Oh, and I run jobs by the finance office. We have to make sure you get paid; that's very important."
"At any time there may be various jobs open to you, you just have to check with me. Or sometimes there might be no jobs if theyre all fulfilled." He reads something on a tablet, "But um, it looks like Provost Baird wants you to have first priority. She must like you."
You're not so sure of this.

[Line 5967] "Welcome back captain, it's good to see you!" Sebestyen says cheerfully.

[Line 5969] He taps at a datapad. "Let me look at what weve got lined up for you today... "

OR
"Um, of course. I understand completely." Sebestyen rapidly scans his datapad, "Let's see what else there is here... "
OR
"Great! You can- " he seems to realize that you declined the mission after a moment.
"You don't want to do it? Oh. Okay. Well. Maybe," he taps his datapad on his desk, "Maybe we can find something else for you?"

"Captain! You might, ah, I've been authorized to provide you with a Neutrino Detector for the mission. Um, a technical crew is transferring the necessary equipment to your flagship, and," he taps his datapad, "I've sent your sensors officer the documentation."
"We've found the Neutrino Detector very helpful for pinpointing interesting, um, all sorts of things while surveying distant systems. Power sources show up especially well, though sometimes you get a false signal. Oh, and one more thing! We haven't figured out a way to quite close the regenerative loop on the plasma reflector uh... and just be sure to stock extra volatiles in your cargo bay to keep the detector running."

[Line 5990] [Option Selected: "Can you do 500,000 credits?"]
"I, I, I-" Sebestyen gapes, at a loss for words at your generosity.
You patiently allow him a few moments to recover, because he needs them.
"I, of course, yes, absolutely captain. Wow! This is incredible! I don't know what to say." He looks around, smiling, and a bit dazed.

"Ah, I- of course, yes." Sebestyen taps a key, closing the word he already started. "If you change your mind, just let me know at any time."

"It is good to see you. Um. It's always good to see you. The provost, however," he coughs again, then leans close. "She's, um, put a... hold on your contract code." He turns his datapad for you to see; it's lit up with bright DENIED alerts.

He turns to you, closes his eyes to brace for a moment, then puts on an impressive smile before proceeding. "So this won't be a problem right? I mean, we have the exact coordinates of the $gaData_target for you. On $gaData_planetName, in the $gaData_systemName system, which is $gaData_dist light-years away.

A longish pause, which is unusual for Academician $personLastName, who has a way of filling uncomfortable gaps in conversation.
"But. Were not supposed to talk about it. But. If you recall all those rumors around the First AI War... well, you can ask in the Persean Studies department maybe? But there is a, um, possibility, maybe, that you will encounter certain, um," $heOrShe looks down to check the exact phrasing, "'autonomous weapon systems'.

$HeOrShe pauses and you watch the process of $himOrHer considering how to phrase $hisOrHer next words. "There are reports of ah, a 'decivilized' population. Probably? They don't have weapons that can take on a spaceship but it says here they have," $heOrShe taps at another datapad, "a lot of handheld weapons. And they're ... fairly hostile. Usually. So, you should definitely bring," yet another datapad, "around $gaData_marinesReq or so marines. Just in case. I mean, hopefully no one gets shot right? Statistically speaking, um. The data suggests that only low casualties are a possibility?"
$HeOrShe looks a little ill at the thought, but recovers quickly, "Once youre back in hypercomms range, just send the encrypted contents back to the Academy and the finance office will pay you $gaData_reward credits. Easy!"

Well provide the exact coordinates of the $gaData_target you need to, um, access. And oh, oh, this is really important," $heOrShe taps a key, switching the display to a stellar diagram that appears to be exploding in two arcs on opposite poles.
Academician $personLastName explains, "$gaData_pulsarName is a pulsar, so youll have to be very, very careful. Im so jealous! Rapidly spinning jets of high energy charged particles, oh, its a once-in-a-lifetime sight. I mean, thats what I hear from the Astrometrics people," $heOrShe sighs. "So, um, hopefully your shields are up to spec?"
$HeOrShe continues, "Once youre back in hypercomms range, send the encrypted contents back to the Academy and the finance office will pay you $gaData_reward credits."

[Line 6033] A nearby hostile fleet is tracking your movements, making a ground operation impossible.

[Line 6035] A scan of the coordinates provided by Academician Sebestyen shows the location is long deserted. Your sensors officer tentatively identifies the $gaData_target on the readout. It appears to be in relatively good shape.

[Line 6035] [Options Given: gaData_get:Send a team down to retrieve the data
defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 6036] A scan of the coordinates provided by Academician Sebestyen shows signs of human presence. There's evidence of recent handheld weapons fire and the use of small-scale explosives, though thankfully it appears the $gaData_target has escaped any serious damage.
Still, it looks like recovering the data will require some shooting.

[Line 6037] [Options Given: mktRaidNonMarket:Consider a ground operation to retrieve the data
gaData_getAvoidCombat:Drop 10 units of supplies at a nearby location to distract the locals

[Line 6038] Your marines provide security while a small salvage team accesses the $gaData_target and extracts the specified data cores.

[Line 6039] [Option Selected: Send a team down to retrieve the data]
You send down a small salvage team. They access the $gaData_target and extract the specified data cores without undue difficulty.

[Line 6040] [Option Selected: Drop 10 units of supplies at a nearby location to distract the locals]
You order some cargo crates loaded with supplies and just enough solid-prop boosters to survive a landing. Once these are deployed and attracting a suitable amount of attention, a small salvage team accesses the $gaData_target and extracts the specified data cores.
The team has to leave quickly, but fortunately - aside from a few small-arms burns on the extraction shuttle - there's no harm done.

pirate fleet interactions

[Line 6043] "Eyh there cap'n. Good work finding the target! We all admire your cleverness," $heOrShe turns over $hisOrHer shoulder to address $hisOrHer crew, "Dont we, ya vac-hogs?"
You hear, quietly, the pirate bridge crew giving a round of "Aye!"s amid hooting and applause.

[Line 6044] The pirate leader turns back to the display. "Now if you don't mind, we'll be takin' those coordinates from you and doing some of the good, honest work that the rich-man is paying us for."

[Line 6044] [Options Given: gaData_transmitCoords:Transmit the coordinates and let the pirates take the data

[Line 6045] The pirate leader turns back to the display. "Now if you dont mind, we'll be takin' a copy of that data from you back to the rich-man who's paying us. Transmit now, if you'd be so kind. Or do we gotta come over and cut the memory core from that fancy flagship you're flying?"

gaData_bluff:"The deal has changed. Youre here to provide me with fuel and supplies."]

[Line 6046] [Option Selected: Transmit the coordinates and let the pirates take the data]
You signal your comms officer to transmit the coordinates. Some cache of data of interest to a bunch of academics isnt worth this trouble.
"Transmission received, captain," says the pirate with a smile. "Its been a..."

[Line 6046] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Close transmission
gaDataCutCommAngry:Hit the end transmission button somewhat harder than strictly necessary]

[Line 6048] [Option Selected: Transmit the data; it's just a copy]
You signal your comms officer to transmit a copy of the data. Its not like the Galatia Academy explicitly requested exclusivity, right? As long as this gets the pirates off your back so you can complete your mission, there's no harm done.
"Transmission received, captain," says the pirate with a smile. "Its been a pleasure..."
You hit the end transmission button a little harder than necessary before the pirate finishes speaking.

[Line 6048] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Continue]

[Line 6050] [Option Selected: Offer to transmit the coordinates ... for a price;['gaData_sellData']]
You explain to the pirate captain that some compensation is required. After all, you traveled all the way out here to provide them with $transmitNoun - good, honest work. $HeOrShe is obviously a practical $manOrWoman of business who knows how to negotiate a beneficial deal for all involved.
After some back and forth, threats and flattery, and not a few lies and boasts, the pirate captain proposes a 'fair compensation' of $gaData_piratePayment credits.

[Line 6050] [Options Given: gaData_acceptOffer:Accept
gaData_rejectOffer:Decline, power up weapons]

[Line 6051] [Option Selected: Accept]
You cut the transmission, having betrayed the spirit of your agreement with the Academy. You consider whether or not to ignore the sinking feeling of guilt that's set up home in your stomach. Still, they'll be none the wiser, and you've got extra credits in your account.

[Line 6052] [Option Selected: Accept]
You cut the transmission, relieved at being able to salvage something out of the situation. Those academics should have warned you there was likely to be competition!

[Line 6053] [Option Selected: Decline, power up weapons]
You cut the transmission and order the bridge crew to prepare for an engagement. Your tactical officer reports the pirate ships are accelerating to attack speed.

[Line 6054] [Option Selected: "The deal has changed. Youre here to provide me with fuel and supplies."]
You sigh impatiently and, with seeming embarrassment for the pirate captain's error, you say "You weren't informed of the change in plans, were you."
You explain that they were intended all along as a support force- more of a supply convoy, really- for your fleet which was to carry out the actual mission. It was all quite clear when you were meeting with the Tri-Tachyon executive in charge of the operation. There must have been some kind of slip-up in communication.

[Line 6054] [Options Given: gaData_bluff1:Continue]

[Line 6055] [Option Selected: Continue]
The pirate captain stumbles on $hisOrHer words, confused by the confidence of your bluff. You remind $himOrHer that while Tri-Tachyon pays excellent bonuses for work performed to specifications, they have been known to take rather extreme punitive measures against those who break contracts and endanger important investments.
You stick to your story, creating believable details on the fly, and manage to take $himOrHer in completely.
"I, yes, ... you!," the pirate captain gestures angrily at some underling, "Get the fuel and supplies transferred NOW." $HeOrShe turns back to the display, sulking "Please, just dont tell the boss about this."

[Line 6055] [Options Given: cutCommLink:"I won't, I promise."]

[Line 6059] [Options Given: gaDA_start:Ask about the scientific object retrieval mission]

[Line 6060] [Option Selected: Ask about the scientific object retrieval mission]
"The $gaDA_department team needs you to pop on over to the $gaDA_systemName, thats $gaDA_dist light-years away, to retrieve, um," he squints at a datapad, "'$gaDA_widget' from a derelict ship."
"I guess its in the ship? Or maybe the cargo? It says here they have a pretty good idea of exactly where it is within the hull itself, anyway. This should be simple, right?"
He pauses briefly. "Oh, the payment! Once you return the $gaDA_widgetNoArticle to the Academy, the finance office will pay you $gaDA_reward credits."

[Line 6060] [Options Given: aseb_accept:Accept
aseb_decline:Decline]

[Line 6061] [Option Selected: Ask about the scientific object retrieval mission]
Academician Sebestyen's eyes go wide as he reads over the datapad, then he quickly looks back to you. 
He puts on a bright smile. "This will be simple, they know exactly where to find the, um," $heOrShe looks back to the datapad, brow creased, "'$gaDA_widgetNoArticle' in the targets hull. Just send a salvage crew, get the thing, and off you go! And thats in the $gaDA_systemName, just $gaDA_dist light-years, there and back with, a few taps on a different datapad, "around $gaDA_fuel units of fuel for your fleet." The academician shifts uncomfortably, as if $heOrShe doesnt want to deliver bad news.

[Line 6061] [Options Given: gaDA_and:"And?"]

[Line 6062] [Option Selected: "And?"]
"And. Well, the last expedition they sent. Um. The last transmission said something about 'hostile AI warships'. Maybe." $HeOrShe drops $hisOrHer voice, "We're not supposed to talk about it. Officially, I mean. But it could be ... maybe dangerous? Thats why this one pays more than usual - $gaDA_reward credits. You can handle it, right?" Academician $personLastName resumes $hisOrHer previous volume "- And everything will be fine! Just get in, retrieve the object, and return it to the Academy."

$HeOrShe rolls $hisOrHer eyes, "You wouldn't believe how bothersome they've been about it. This is wonderful, I'll get your payment transferred immediately."
OR
Academician $personLastName glances between the two datapads he's holding, one in each hand.
"Captain, you have no idea how worried $gaDA_department was about this, um." He considers for a moment, "'$gaDA_widget', that's what it was! They'll be absolutely delighted when I let them know you found it!"
"First though, I'll let the finance office know to release your payment."

derelict interactions
------------------------------
[Line 6065] Your $shipOrFleet makes a pass by the derelict, allowing your sensors officer to give it a cursory scan. Identity of target is verified positive, but with hostiles nearby you can't safely run a deep scan or dispatch salvage teams to investigate and find $gaDA_widget.

[Line 6065] [Options Given: 100:defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 6067] Your $shipOrFleet intercepts the derelict. Your sensors officer runs a full-spectrum active scan, noting outgassing and signs of residual heat. This is a fresh hulk, as derelicts go. You order telemetry logged to the mission report file for the Academy; they love extra data, and it'll prove you've done the job.
Your operations chief oversees the dispatch of salvage teams as they perform a clean, efficient breach and survey of the hulk. The mission target is missing from its position in the experiment team's project spec, but a young, green spacer follows signs of elevated radiation and soon discovers the $gaDA_widgetNoArticle in a secondary lab space.
Your ops chief meets your eyes and gives a gruff nod. Success. The target is packaged and extracted in record time; all that remains is to return it to the Galatia Academy.

[Line 6067] [Options Given: gaDA_continueBasic:Leave]

[Line 6068] Your $shipOrFleet intercepts the derelict. Your sensors officer runs a deep active-scan, noting rad-hot volumes and structure damage. This is a fresh, warm hulk, as derelicts go. Your ops chief sees the look you are about to give and orders the salvage teams to bring extra work-drones for the hot sectors.
You follow the sweep of salvage teams through the hulk, flicking through display feeds of dead passageways clouded by ghostly debris. The mission target is exactly where it was supposed to be, but you suspect the glaze of carbon-silica on the facing wall was not an intended byproduct of the experiment. The $gaDA_widgetNoArticle appears to be largely intact.
Your ops chief personally oversees packaging and extraction of the target. All that remains is to return it to the Galatia Academy.

[Line 6068] [Options Given: gaDA_continueBasic:Leave]

[Line 6070] As you approach the derelict your sensors officer points out signs that you're not the first to visit. Outgassing and debris around the targets hull match the profile of a recent salvage operation.
"More like a smash and grab," growls your ops chief. Whoever got here first was not a professional judging by the slipshod breaching cuts and tangle of discarded equipment.
You send out a salvage team, and they perform a sweep with cautious efficiency. Your mission target is missing, but they do find something unexpected: a leaky suit crudely bolted to a bulkhead, occupant unconscious. The victim of some punishment, evidently. Theyre cut free then placed in a quarantined bulkhead while a medic attempts to revive them.

[Line 6070] [Options Given: gaDA_continuePirates:Continue]

[Line 6071] [Option Selected: Continue]
The victim is thankful and eager to talk- and definitely a pirate. You watch through a holofeed as a story comes out about being left behind due to a perceived transgression which, "-the others got talking and decided just 'cause they didn't like me much that I was the one to blame. I didn't do a thing to deserve it!"
All of your questions are answered at the cost of only breathable air, a hot meal, and a bulb of spirits.
It becomes clear that these pirates knew something special was on the derelict and came here looking for it. They were also caching supplies nearby, so it's likely they'll head there before trying to sell their treasure. If your fleet travels at high speed, you might just catch the pirates before they get away.

[Line 6071] [Options Given: gaDA_continuePirates2:Continue]

[Line 6072] [Option Selected: Continue]
All that remains is what is to be done with the unfortunate pirate who seems grateful and claims to have been wronged, but is any pirate out here really innocent? Could they be a security risk?

[Line 6072] [Options Given: gaDA_returnPirate:Pirates can't be trusted. Return them to the leaky ship.
gaDA_takePirateIn:Give them a chance to prove themselves. (+1 crew)]

[Line 6074] [Options Given: gaDA_returnPirateCont:Leave]

[Line 6076] You approach the derelict. Your sensors officer quickly points out signs that you're not the first to have found it: Outgassing and debris around the targets hull match the profile of a recent salvage operation. "... And they were professionals," growls your ops chief with more than a hint of respect. Whoever got here first made efficient breaching cuts at key access points, leaving only a neat net of lines secured to borer-pitons favored by deep-space salvage rats.
You send out a salvage team knowing what they'll find, and they perform their sweep with cautious efficiency. Your mission target is missing; you order the team's telemetry and holo feeds to be attached to the mission file as proof that you performed this job for the Academy to the best of your ability.

[Line 6076] [Options Given: gaDA_continueScav:Continue]

[Line 6077] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Captain." Your operations chief calls attention to an active screen displaying the residual heat around the breaching cuts. "They're still hot. We might be able to catch the scavengers who made these cuts."
Your mind races, putting a plan together. If you burn fast toward the closest jump-point - their logical destination, possibly after spending more time in-system - you might just catch the scavengers before they jump for hyperspace. Perhaps they can be persuaded to give up the piece you're looking for.

[Line 6077] [Options Given: gaDA_scavLeave:Leave]

[Line 6079] The bridge crew is muted; they fear the alien power of the Remnants of the First AI War. You'll want to pull off this operation quickly, before you set off some half-functioning threat algorithm in unseen watchers.
Your operations chief dispatches salvage teams. They perform an efficient breach and survey of the hulk. Battle damage and agrav failure has made a riotous mess of the internal volumes, but your experienced crews have dealt with this situation on countless occasions. They spread out, setting temporary cargo nets to contain and sort the slowly drifting clouds of salvage. Using search parameters based on the specs provided by the Galatia Academy experiment team, the $gaDA_widgetNoArticle is located and secured.
The chief notes the mission time elapsed and gives a gruff word of approval over the comms. The teams return, nervous but in good spirits, with their treasure in tow. You need not linger in this place.

conversation with pirates
------------------------------
[Line 6082] Your sensors officer reports that an ejected cargo pod floating in a spray of post-battle debris contains something that matches the mission target specifications. A salvage team quickly secures the object in your hold.

[Line 6084] The comms open and before you stands the pirate leader. "What do you want, scavenger?" $heOrShe says with contempt.
"This is our cache and if you know what's best you'll be burning along to find some shiny bits out elsewhere to grub at."

[Line 6084] [Options Given: gaDA_offerToBuy:Offer to buy what they found in the derelict
gaDA_threaten:Threaten to attack if they don't surrender the mission target
gaDA_kantaSentMe:"Kanta sent me. She wants her prize."]

[Line 6085] [Option Selected: Offer to buy what they found in the derelict]
You explain to the pirate captain that you know exactly what they've found, and it's only really useful to a bunch of bookish academics. Despite being useless dirt-worms, they'll give good credits for certain pieces of garbage that you find in a long-standing arrangement. If the Pirates sell it to you now it'll save them a long trip to the core worlds. And having to deal with the most condescending fools in the entire Sector.
$HeOrShe considers your words, then says "You make some good points, captain. I do hate it when worthless mud-boots try to talk down to me. And," $heOrShe gives you a fierce look, "I don't need another mass murder charge on my bounty just for some piece of junk." 
After some additional implied threats and a bit of negotiation on your part,  the pirate captain offers to sell you what they found for $gaDA_piratePayment credits.

[Line 6085] [Options Given: gaDA_buyAgree:Agree to their price
gaDA_buyDecline:Decline, its simply not worth it
gaDA_buyDeclineAggro:"I've decided to take it from you by force."]

[Line 6087] [Option Selected: Decline, its simply not worth it]
You cut the comm link after explaining to the pirate captain that you wouldn't make enough on the deal to cover your expenses. The rapport you've established during the negotiation seems to incline $himOrHer to let you go, at least for the moment.

[Line 6088] [Option Selected: "I've decided to take it from you by force."]
"Oh, I see how it is," the pirate captain snarls, raising a gauntleted fist. "If you were going to make me kill you anyway, why'd you waste precious atmo with all that chum talk?"
The comms snap to static; you speculate that you don't hear the fist slam on the pirate's console because the link cut out just before the shock reverberated to the pickups. Yes, that explains it. You turn to find that your tactical officer has just finished sending a combat alert to the $shipOrFleet.

[Line 6088] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6089] [Option Selected: "I've decided to take it from you by force."]
The pirate captain cries out in a panic, $hisOrHer contemptuous airs dispelled in a moment. "Wait! Were just doing business here, I can compromise!" $HeOrShe sweats, visibly calculating for a moment, "How about $gaDA_piratePaymentLow credits for this piece of junk? Be reasonable, captain, we can make this work for both of us."

[Line 6089] [Options Given: gaDA_buyAgree:Accept the new price
cutCommLink:Decline. Snap comms off and power up battle-systems.]

[Line 6090] [Option Selected: Threaten to attack if they don't surrender the mission target]
The pirate captain laughs heartily, but you detect just a note of panic underlying the bravado. "Oh, well done. I thought we were the pirates here, but no it is you. I admire you, captain."
A pause for drama, "And I admire your powerful fleet even more. Some of my comrades-of-the-void," $heOrShe looks around, appearing to address $hisOrHer crew, "would consider surrendering our loot a cowardly act. But I'll be the coward who lives every time over a fight I know I can't win. Unless we have any volunteers who would like to suit up and take them on? No?"
With this, $heOrShe smiles then strikes a bow as the comms close. A moment later your tactical officer reports that a cargo drone has been dispatched from the pirate fleet.

[Line 6090] [Options Given: gaDA_buyAgree:Collect the mission target]

[Line 6091] [Option Selected: Threaten to attack if they don't surrender the mission target]
The pirate captain laughs heartily with unfeigned bravado. "Oh, well done. I thought we were the pirates here, but no, I think it must be you. I admire your spirit, captain." A pause for drama, "May it haunt the stars only briefly."
$HeOrShe executes a half spin, raises $hisOrHer arm like a conductor, and brings it down. The connection terminates.
Your tactical officer reports, "Hostiles closing, sir."

[Line 6091] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6092] [Option Selected: "Kanta sent me. She wants her prize."]
The blood drains from the pirate captain's face. "She ... did? But she said ... all was forgiven. She said it was balanced out, she said I made it up to her." $HeOrShe seems really worried. Better lay it on.

[Line 6092] [Options Given: gaDA_kanta1:"Kanta never forgets. But if she hasn't killed you yet..."
gaDA_kanta2:"I could tell her I killed you. Change your name. Change your face. Stay far away."]

[Line 6093] [Option Selected: "Kanta never forgets. But if she hasn't killed you yet..."]
"... Then," the pirate, almost in tears, completes your sentence, "... she must want me alive for some reason. And I'm only useful to her if I'm alive, right?" A deep breath. "That makes sense. I owe her still. I always will. But she'll see how loyal I am, right? You'll tell her I'm loyal?" The pirate looks to you, pleading.

[Line 6093] [Options Given: gaDA_kanta1a:"Absolutely loyal."]

[Line 6094] [Option Selected: "Absolutely loyal."]
You manage to extricate yourself from comms link-up with the blubbering pirate captain just as your operations chief confirms that a cargo drone has delivered a package from the lead pirate ship.

[Line 6094] [Options Given: gaDA_buyAgree:Continue]

[Line 6095] [Option Selected: "I could tell her I killed you. Change your name. Change your face. Stay far away."]
"Yes, yes. Yes yes yes. That might work. And- yes, if I give you whatever this stupid thing is, youll do this? Tell her you saw me die?" The pirate captain looks to you, pleading.

[Line 6095] [Options Given: gaDA_kanta2a:"I'm picturing it right now."]

[Line 6096] [Option Selected: "I'm picturing it right now."]
"Wonderful!" $HeOrShe looks as though an enormous weight has lifted off $hisOrHer shoulders. "Thank you for ... for this opportunity. Freedom! At last!"
Only the promise that you'll make up a good story about how they went out guns ablaze gets the pirate captain off the comms. You sigh, and just then your operations chief pings your attention to note that a cargo drone has delivered a package from the lead pirate ship.

[Line 6096] [Options Given: gaDA_buyAgree:Continue]


------------------------------
conversation with scavenger
------------------------------
[Line 6098] You've caught up with the scavengers who took the $gaDA_widgetNoArticle. You glance at the tactical report in the tense moments before comms link-up. They're an armed fleet, but not heavily, and you're far from the core worlds. If you were to attack this fleet and prevail, you are unlikely to face serious repercussions from any major faction, or even the independent polities. 
Still. No matter how tight the infosec or how loyal the crew, dark rumors always swirl in the wake of bloodthirsty captains. The incoming comms request light blinks at you.

[Line 6099] An image of $personName, commander of the independent scavenger fleet, coalesces before you. In just a look, you can see in $hisOrHer eyes that you both understand the stakes in meeting a stranger in the dark volume outside the core worlds. 
"Bright stars, captain," $heOrShe says in greeting. "What brings you to this humble orbit?"

[Line 6099] [Options Given: gaDA_scavBuy:"You found something I need. Let's make a deal."
gaDA_scavThreaten:"I want what you found. Send it over. Those are my only terms."
gaDA_scavBluff:"Say, aren't you $personName?" (bluff)]

[Line 6100] [Option Selected: "You found something I need. Let's make a deal."]
You begin to negotiate, a game you both know, and argue that if they sell this item of unknown provenance to you now, you can help them avoid a long trip back to the core worlds, at which point they'd only have to waste more time and fuel shopping around to find the right buyer. Captain $personLastName counters, "It is clear that you have a buyer in mind. Why not divulge their comms ID for a cash payment?" You shake your head, and explain that the exclusive relationship you have is worth more than the one job. 
The negotiation goes back and forth, both parties acknowledging the commercial interest of the other by various points, until the independent captain comes to a price for the $gaDA_widgetNoArticle.
"I think $gaDA_scavPayment credits is more than fair," $heOrShe says with that touch of finality which signals that this negotiation is at its end.

[Line 6100] [Options Given: gaDA_scavBuyAccept:Agree to their price
cutCommLink:Decline, its simply not worth it]

[Line 6102] [Option Selected: "I want what you found. Send it over. Those are my only terms."]
The scavenger captain folds $hisOrHer arms and gives the smallest of nods to someone off-screen. "I see," $heOrShe says, "We're going to do it like that. Well, let's not waste time. Time is money, and fighting is a good way for everyone to lose a lot of both."
"You can pay me $gaDA_scavPaymentHigh credits for my work, and then I will surrender to you this 'thing'. Or you can try to attack my fleet and waste a lot more money than that sum. My tactical projections do not estimate a great chance of victory for your $shipOrFleet."
"So, how's it going to be?"

[Line 6102] [Options Given: gaDA_scavBuyAccept:Pay $gaDA_scavPaymentHigh credits to receive the mission target
cutCommLink:Refuse and prepare to attack]

[Line 6103] [Option Selected: "I want what you found. Send it over. Those are my only terms."]
The scavenger captain folds $hisOrHer arms and gives the smallest of nods to someone off-screen. "I see," $heOrShe says, "We're going to do it like that. Well, let's not waste time. Time is money, and fighting is a good way for everyone to lose a lot of both."
"You can pay me $gaDA_scavPaymentHigh credits for my work, and then I will surrender to you this 'thing'. Or you can try to attack my fleet and waste a lot more money than that sum. My tactical projections do not estimate a great chance of victory for your $shipOrFleet."

[Line 6104] [Option Selected: "I want what you found. Send it over. Those are my only terms."]
The scavenger captain folds $hisOrHer arms and gives the smallest of nods to someone off-screen. "I see," $heOrShe says, "We're going to do it like that. Well, let's not waste time. Time is money, and fighting is a good way for everyone to lose a lot of both."
$HeOrShe seems remarkably detached during this exchange. You realize that $heOrShe sees your threat and $hisOrHer loss as simply a matter of business. "I accept your terms. Please be ready to receive a cargo drone. Now if you'll excuse me captain, we have work to do." 
The comms snap off rather abruptly. Your display reports a cargo drone with the package is incoming.

[Line 6104] [Options Given: gaDA_scavBuyAccept:Continue]

[Line 6105] You order the credits transfer. The scavenger unfolds $hisOrHer arms and makes a small motion to a subordinate. 
"A profitable exchange for all, I trust. Until next time, captain," $heOrShe says with a small, all-business smile.
You close the comms. Your logistics officer reports that a disposable cargo drone has delivered the package.

[Line 6106] You order the credits transfer. The scavenger unfolds $hisOrHer arms and makes a small motion to a subordinate. 
"Until next time, captain," $heOrShe says, locking $hisOrHer gaze on you through the comms-line. You could swear that under that all-business facade $heOrShe is burning your face into long-term memory.
You close the comms and receive a report from your logistics officer that a disposable cargo drone has delivered the package.

[Line 6106] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6107] [Option Selected: "Say, aren't you $personName?" (bluff)]
The scavenger blinks. "Yes, my name is in the comms IDs we exchanged when this line was opened."
It's coming back to you now. Some minor report while in dock a ways back, you're not sure why you read so deeply into the neighboring vessels ownership status and history of public contract affiliations. Just something to pass the time while cargo is moved, perhaps.
You explain, referencing the details you now recall, that they are the $personName who is serving a long-term contract for the Provenance Supply Stock Combine, registered with the good ol' APCC- the Agreus Provisional Commerce Concordat. And it's a good thing you found them now rather than having them find out about it when they got back to Nortia.
"Find out what," $heOrShe says in flat anticipation of bad news.

[Line 6107] [Options Given: gaDA_scavBluff2:"The results of the investigation, of course."]

[Line 6108] [Option Selected: "The results of the investigation, of course."]
$HeOrShe looks worried. "The investigation?"
You shake your head as you tell of the scandal and subsequent legal action that has toppled most of the board of directors of the PSSC after the APCC was tipped off about funds being shuffled between certain providers of 'ghost capital' in a scheme involving heavy weapons smuggled into Pather space leveraged off prime Eventide real estate. The rot goes deep, and with interfactional diplomatic pressure, the Concordat will see more heads roll in the upcoming cycle, that's for sure.
The captain looks more and more like a spaced corpse as you lay it on.

[Line 6108] [Options Given: gaDA_scavBluff3:"But your real problem is the expropriation order..."]

[Line 6109] [Option Selected: "But your real problem is the expropriation order..."]
"The... ", $heOrShe can't even bring $himOrHerself to say it.
"Yes," you confirm regretfully. The sum of property owned by the PSSC- and leased, covenant-bonded, indentured, or contracted elements thereof, are all forfeit to the APCC to be sold off to pay for the enormous fees and fines. And rights to that property that is still, as they say, 'in-transit' has been sold off in an anonymous auction.
All in all, it's a good thing you got here first to tip them off about the mess. Why, they could have found themselves adrift in a life-pod and missing every redundant organ if an unsavory repossessor found them first. With this warning, they can scrub their transponder ID, sell everything they're carrying on the black market, then buy citizenship on any independent polity they want with seed capital leftover for whatever venture comes next.

[Line 6110] [Option Selected: "As a tip for the tip-off, perhaps I could take a bit of that salvage..."]
Captain $personLastName quickly agrees that you've been more than helpful, and that one very specific bin of salvage is hardly enough of a reward for what you've done. You can only shake your head and smile, explaining that out among the stars independent captains like you and $himOrHer have to look out for one another.
The scavenger looks at you with grim determination as you say your goodbyes. "Burn bright, Captain $playerName. And thank you once more." You close the comms-link just as your logistics officer reports that a cargo drone has delivered the mission target.

You can believe that without reservation.
He looks to you hopefully. "So you'll run this instrument package for the $gaCO_department team?"

[Line 6120] [Option Selected: Ask about the $gaCO_celestialObjectType scan]
Academician Sebestyen seems especially excited to tell you about this mission; you can tell by how his eyes light up.
"Applied Holoarts, how fun! They have this amazing all-frequencies high-res holoscan matrix and it makes just the most wonderful holos. Let's see, the team just wants you to run their pre-coded approach on $gaCO_celestialObjectNameWithTypeLong in the $gaCO_starName system, about $gaCO_dist light-years away. The instrument package will take care of everything automatically once you're at the mission target, you just need to watch the show. When it's done, it'll send a hyperwave pulse to signal completion, and that'll release the honorarium of $gaCO_reward credits to your account." 
Academician Sebestyen finally takes a breath, and you take this moment of quiet to consider the logistics of the operation. "I wonder what this scan is for, I can't wait to see it," he says. "This'll be so neat!"

"Right. Yes." Academician Sebestyen seems nervous, but after a moment of ever-so-brief inner turmoil, appears to make the decision to power through the briefing.
"... Okay. For this one you would need to go to $gaCO_celestialObjectNameWithTypeShort in the $gaCO_starName system, which is $gaCO_dist light-years away. Once in orbit of the target, the instrument package provided by the $gaCO_department team will link to your navigation system with the necessary information to do the, um, sweep. And um. Youll want to time this very carefully because, um."
Is his resolve wavering? 

[Line 6121] [Options Given: gaCO_pulsarCont:Raise a single eyebrow]

This seems to set the academician back on course. "What you need to know is that, ah, $gaCO_starName is a pulsar. So you'll have to be very careful, right? I mean, it's not so bad, you just need to time your approach. Right? And," he seems to perk up, "you'll get to see rapidly spinning jets of high energy charged particles, it'll be the most amazing show!"
"The package will ping us with an encrypted hypercomms pulse once it's done, and that'll release your funds. Oh! Right, the honorarium is $gaCO_reward credits. That's important."
He lets out a breath, looking relieved to have finished the briefing.

[Line 6129] The channel opens to the scowling face of a Pather fanatic. "Defiler! Interloper! $HeOrShe spits the words. "We know well of your kind, for you are not the first to be sent from the Galatia Academy, that foul temple of Belial which vomits up corrupt servants to broadcast profanities upon holy creation!"
"Eject the demonic artifact," $heOrShe hisses the words like they're a curse, "so that we may eliminate it. After this act of supplication, and only after, we might consider praying for your forgiveness, blessing of Ludd be upon even those who malign the Path."
You consider the situation. If you eject the instrument package for the Pathers to play target practice with, the Galatia Academy won't be pleased, and you haven't been paid yet. Still, it's likely to avoid a fight.

The Pather almost smiles, like $heOrShe expected and welcomes your rejection. Here, now, $heOrShe can prove that $heOrShe is a worthy martyr for the cause.
"Blessed be the holy void," the Pather says through eyes cast heavensward, "Through this we return as dust to the stars, the crucible of our maker..."

"Now," $heOrShe intones, to $himOrHerself, to you, to the crew listening, "together we pray."
The Pather captain leads you through a classic Luddic prayer, begging forgiveness and of harming not holy creation. You stumble through the bits you happen to know, and mumble along with the rest. The Pather seems content with your effort, at least.

You know how these Pathers work. It's not hard.
You put on a look of grave concern, "$BrotherOrSister, I fear you have misunderstood the situation completely. It is true that we had contact with the academicians, those priests of Belial in their ivory temple of hubris and spiritual decay, but it is not as you assume."

Witness: that we have taken this demonic device far from their temple of lies, and yea, we shall throw it down this gravity well that it might burn up and be only atoms once more as clay to be wrought by the ways of Creation."

You lead the befuddled Pather in a classic Luddic prayer without missing a word, then exchange fond farewells and blessings with $personName. After you close the channel, you stop a moment to find your bridge crew looking at you with a combination of awe and confusion.

Eject your demonic machine of science," that word spoken as a hissed curse, "that we may destroy it in cleansing fire."
Is that all? No - the Pather was drawing breath to continue the tirade "- Then pay us a goodly sum, a tithe for your unholy crime, and only then we might consider praying for your forgiveness! Answer now, heretic!"
You consider the situation. The job is already done, so you dont need the instrument package. Paying off the Pathers would let you leave without a fight.

They sent it to the $gaProbe_starName system to study, um, $gaProbe_celestialObjectNameWithType. It doesn't say here what it was for exactly, just that they need it back."
Sebestyen sees the look you're giving him. "I know, I know. You're not just here to fetch packages. But this really is important. It's cutting-edge science! It benefits us all!" He furrows his brow. "Somehow. Probably."
"So not the whole thing, just the instrument package right? It's small and won't take up any cargo space, I promise. And, good news here, the bursar has authorized a payment of $gaProbe_reward credits for recovery. So what do you think?"

Well, $gaProbe_department needs the instrument package from a probe sent to the $gaProbe_starName system recovered. It's $gaProbe_dist light-years away. And I know what you're thinking, you're not a packet-minder who fetches packages."
"But this is science!" Sebestyen slams his datapad down, surprising himself. "It's important! It can save the Sector from a fall into, into, some kind of new dark age!"

"Small power source, active," your sensors officer reports. "No debris. Nav ping returns normal. Everything looks clean, $playerSirOrMadam."
The salvage team maneuvers to the probe and you watch the displays flare as a few clean cuts are made through the probe hull. Within minutes the job is done and the salvage team returned with the Academy's instrument package in tow.

[Line 6153] Your $shipOrFleet approaches the probe, finding it exactly where Academician Sebestyen's specifications told you it would be. 
"$PlayerSirOrMadam," your sensors officer's tone tells you that it is not good news, "The probe shell is empty. However..." 
The main bridge display lights up, showing temperature readings on cut-marks; a small spray of debris whose trajectory can be reversed to a point; slowly dissipating clouds of close-maneuvering propellant. The story these signs tell is clear: a scavenger was here, and very recently.
Your nav officer speaks up, "$PlayerSirOrMadam, if we burn now for the closest jump-point, we might be able to catch them."

[Line 6153] [Options Given: defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 6154] Your $shipOrFleet approaches the probe, finding it exactly where Academician Sebestyen's mission specs told you it would be. What is odd, however, are the derelict ships and debris field surrounding the probe's position.
Sensor sweeps confirm that the derelicts are indeed derelict and that they are recent; well within the probe's mission operation period. You order all stations to alert, and order further active scans of the entire volume with all telemetry logged to the mission file.

[Line 6154] [Options Given: gaProbe_blewUp1:Continue]

[Line 6155] [Option Selected: Continue]
Reports come in from your bridge crew; sensors, tactical, and ops- a small fleet seems to have been torn apart by highly energetic discharge. Weapons fire? Maybe. But maybe not. Did two groups of scavengers fight over right-of-recovery? Did one fleet turn on itself? It does happen.
Did the probe defend itself with some Domain-era ultratech?
"$PlayerSirOrMadam," your ops chief draws your attention from the reports spread across your display, "I recommend we pull the $shipOrFleet back to safe distance before EVA."

[Line 6155] [Options Given: gaProbe_blewUp2:Continue]

[Line 6156] [Option Selected: Continue]
The salvage team maneuvers from a trio of carrier drones toward the probe, calling and confirming their approach as you follow their progress. Static crackles in waves across the feed displays on the bridge. Interference from the probe, probably.
"Report contact." The salvage team coordinates readings with your ops chief. Lines are secured to the probe's hull and equipment deployed.
"Torch ready, making the cut." Another wave of static. 
Your ops chief exchanges an expressionless look with you as the salvage team breaches the probe casing.

[Line 6156] [Options Given: gaProbe_blewUp3:Continue]

[Line 6157] [Option Selected: Continue]
Your sensors officer cuts in suddenly, "Advise ops, we see neutrino surge in target. Geometric rise, eight-k tick period." 
Your ops chief zooms a display into a holo of the instrument package, panning rapidly through a series of highlighted subsystems and annotated conduits. The chief overrides comms to give a precise set of technical instructions in short authoritative barks, receiving confirms as each step is carried out. "Execute." 
The comms roar with white noise, and the over-shoulder display feed flares to static.

[Line 6157] [Options Given: gaProbe_blewUp4:Continue]

[Line 6158] [Option Selected: Continue]
The noise recedes. "Report confirm." 
The over-shoulder display feed re-focuses on the salvage team amid a small cloud of expanding volatiles. One figure is applying sealant to another as a damaged cutting torch drifts on an equipment line. "Report blue-five minor suit damage. Integrity good."
The after-action report draws an unclear picture. The instrument package was building up some kind of energy discharge only to be interrupted when your salvors cut off main power. Damage was minimal. Nonetheless, you consider that the Galatia Academy could have given some - or indeed any - warning of this possibility. You make a note to bring up the matter of a hazard bonus with Academician Sebestyen.

[Line 6158] [Options Given: defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 6159] Your $shipOrFleet approaches the probe, finding it roughly where Sebestyen's specifications told you it should be. 
"No power source detected. Mass lower than expected. No debris. Nav ping- no response," your sensors officer reports. "Probe hull looks intact, captain." 
The salvage team maneuvers toward the probe and you watch the displays flare as a few clean cuts open the casing. Confused chatter fills the comms.
"Zero that loose talk," barks your ops chief. "EVA team lead, report!"

[Line 6159] [Options Given: gaProbe_missing1:Continue]

Over comms, the report comes in, "It's empty, Chief. Conduits sheared off cleanly. No instrument package. Nothing."
Later, after the salvage team returns, you review their findings with your bridge crew. It appears as though a perfect sphere has been scooped from the center of the probe, taking most of the Galatia Academy's precious instrument package with it.
Theories are proposed. Black hole. Aliens; this prompts a round of polite laughter. Your tech officer steps up and explains that it is theoretically possible to bulk phase-shift matter at a distance, though the process was never considered economical even in the later cycles of the Domain. Your operations chief looks skeptical of the entire notion.

[Line 6160] [Options Given: gaProbe_missing2:Continue]

[Line 6161] [Option Selected: Continue]
Whatever did this, it means you don't have an instrument package to return to the Galatia Academy. You order all telemetry and holo-feed from the encounter attached to the encrypted mission file. The academicians love data, the more the better. This should be enough to demonstrate that you did your job to the letter. Maybe the mystery at the heart of it will distract them long enough for you to get paid.

Sebestyen has that look of trying to avoid telling the full story here. Probably best to let him off the hook with this one. He clears his throat to fill the growing silence as you maintain a strictly professional expression. "I've confirmed with the finance office and your payment should be released now."
OR
"Hello captain, I just got the news!" Sebestyen pauses a moment, as if expecting you to know exactly what he's talking about. "Um, from Logistics? They just received the instrument package from your $shipOrFleet. For $gaProbe_department?"
You nod to acknowledge the transfer of material as per your mission requirements. 
"Um, good job. No, great job! The finance department should release payment immediately." He seems a little disappointed that you aren't as excited as he is, but he shrugs and soldiers on.

[Line 6167] [Options Given: contact_pickAnotherGreeting:Continue]

[Line 6168] [Option Selected: Calmly explain the concept of a hazard bonus]
You explain that the instrument package in the probe turned out to be exceptionally dangerous and that, as a professional, you expect to be informed of the possibility of such danger. A hazard bonus added to mission payment seems like a fair compromise in this case, with the amount proportionate to the danger faced. 
To emphasize your request, you tap a key and transmit documentation of the blasted derelicts surrounding the probe; and the spinning debris- if you look closely, is that... no, don't look too closely.
Academician Sebestyen looks queasy. "Um. Pardon me captain; just a moment."

[Line 6168] [Options Given: gaProbe_returnHazard1:Continue ]

[Line 6169] [Option Selected: Continue]
A few minutes later Sebestyen re-activates the on-hold comms line. Out of professional courtesy you stop drumming your fingers on the console.
"I'm very, very, very sorry about the whole situation, captain," he stammers, "I um, had a quick chat with finance and they've agreed to add a fifty percent, um, hazard bonus? To your payment. So that makes it $gaProbe_reward credits. I really, really hope you choose to continue to work with us."

[Line 6170] Sebestyen looks up from a datapad as the comms open. "Captain! Back so soon? I thought you were, ah- " He trails off at your look.
You explain the situation surrounding the probe's missing instrument package to the academician.
"Fascinating! Ooh, it's even better than I ever expected." He claps his hands once in excitement, "I can't wait to see what the $gaProbe_department group makes of this. Um. If it's okay I'll just forward this file to them now-"

[Line 6170] [Options Given: gaProbe_returnMissing1:"About the payment."]

[Line 6171] [Option Selected: "About the payment."]
"Oh yes, of course," he says. "Payment first, then the data transfer."
Sebestyen taps at a display and you note the ping of incoming funds on your personal TriPad.

conversation with Pather
------------------------------
[Line 6175] The comms channel buzzes and crackles to reveal the Pather commander. $HeOrShe is not quite what you expected; it is not burning zeal you see in their eyes, but something else.
"Captain. By the stars, I come to you on the path of peace." $HisOrHer voice rasps with what you recognize as vacuum damage. 
"Beware yon spore of Moloch. Some evil science is at work here in that probe, it has unleashed power beyond... beyond all reckoning. It took many of my fellow walkers. Spilled their life into the holy void. I warn you now, leave this cursed place."

[Line 6175] [Options Given: gaProbe_endPolite:Thank them for the warning and close comms
gaProbe_endRude:Snap off the comm link
gaProbe_offerAid:Offer fuel and supplies to the crippled Pather fleet
gaProbe_attackNow:Attack now, while they are weakened]

[Line 6178] [Option Selected: Offer fuel and supplies to the crippled Pather fleet]
In the spirit of the sacred peace with which they approach, you ask the Pather if they could use fuel and supplies to aid their survival.
$HeOrShe is confused by your charity, and you see a look of hostility on $hisOrHer face for a moment. But it breaks into genuine gratitude. "We- yes, we would accept your aid in sacred peace. If you could spare $patherFuel units of fuel and $patherSupplies units of supplies, it would allow us to return to... to home."

[Line 6178] [Options Given: gaProbe_giveAid:Give them the supplies and fuel
gaProbe_denyAid:Deny them aid]

[Line 6179] You have $player.fuel fuel and $player.supplies supplies.

[Line 6180] You only have $player.fuel fuel and $player.supplies supplies - not enough to provide meaningful help.

[Line 6181] [Option Selected: Give them the supplies and fuel]
You order your logistics officer to dispatch the requested fuel and supplies by cargo drone.
The Pather leader awkwardly thanks you, and says "May the stars show you Ludd's path, captain... $playerName. I will not forget this." 
The comms link closes with a crackle of static.

[Line 6181] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6182] [Option Selected: Deny them aid]
As you tell $himOrHer of your decision to deny them aid, you see the Pather's eyes harden. This is once more the familiar face of the Luddic Path.
"Then the only mercy left to us is the Creator's holy void," $heOrShe says bitterly. "May the stars guide you to... to Ludd's path. Someday." The Pather turns away and the comms link cuts to static.

[Line 6182] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6183] [Option Selected: Attack now, while they are weakened]
You cut the transmission and order the bridge crew to power up combat systems. Your tactical officer reports the Pather ships are accelerating to attack speed - choosing a death in battle over slowly expiring in the void.

conversation with scavenger
------------------------------
[Line 6186] Your sensors officer reports that an ejected cargo pod floating in a spray of post-battle debris contains a hulless instrument chassis that matches the specs from the Galatia Academy hyperspace research group which Coureuse was a part of.

[Line 6187] The comms link crackles with static, then clears to an image of the scavenger captain. 
"Greetings fellow starfarer," $heOrShe says. "What brings you out here? Can't say we've found much worth salvaging lately, ha-ha."
Something seems a little off. It doesn't feel like pirates this time. What is it?

[Line 6187] [Options Given: cutCommLinkPolite:Probably nothing. Exchange pleasantries and sign off.
gaProbe_confront:Request that they transfer the probe's instrument package to you. Immediately.]

[Line 6188] [Option Selected: Request that they transfer the probe's instrument package to you. Immediately.]
$HeOrShe looks shocked. "I... " $heOrShe swallows. With a dry throat; you can tell. "The package? I mean, what probe? Dammit."
The pretense drops under your withering stare. "It's ours fair and square," $heOrShe stammers, "Right of salvage. We all know how it works."

[Line 6188] [Options Given: gaProbe_confront1:Ask if the probe's transponder was active when this "salvage" took place]

[Line 6189] [Option Selected: Ask if the probe's transponder was active when this "salvage" took place]
You explain that, as every scavenger knows, an uncrewed probe with an operational transponder is not legal salvage. And the Galatia Academy is a very well connected institution. And the Academy has been known to be rather litigious when it comes to their research equipment. 
Guilt is written across the captain's face. "We just... we were going to-"

[Line 6189] [Options Given: gaProbe_confront2:"Immediately transfer the instrument package to my ship."]

[Line 6190] [Option Selected: "Immediately transfer the instrument package to my ship."]
"Yes, of course." $HeOrShe turns to an underling and says something that isn't quite picked up by the comms. "It'll be in-transit in just a moment, captain."
$HeOrShe mumbles an abashed farewell platitude and signs off just as your logistics officer reports an incoming cargo drone.

cutCommLinkNoText:"I'm sorry to hear it. Burn bright."]

[Line 6192] [Option Selected: Confront them about the probe]
$HeOrShe looks shocked. "I... " $heOrShe swallows. With a dry throat; you can tell. "The package? I mean, what probe? Dammit."
The pretense drops under your withering stare, replaced with defiance. "It's ours fair and square. Right of salvage. We all know how it works."

[Line 6192] [Options Given: gaProbe_confrontAfter1:Ask if the probe's transponder was active when this "salvage" took place]

[Line 6193] [Option Selected: Ask if the probe's transponder was active when this "salvage" took place]
"Well." $HeOrShe glances to one side, as if someone over there might have a better answer than the truth.

[Line 6193] [Options Given: gaProbe_confrontAfter2:Explain "how it works" to the scavenger]

[Line 6194] [Option Selected: Explain "how it works" to the scavenger]
You explain that, as every scavenger knows, an uncrewed probe with an operational transponder is not legal salvage. And that the Galatia Academy is a very well connected institution. And that the Academy is extremely litigious when it comes to meddling with their research equipment.
Guilt is written across the captain's face. $HeOrShe stammers "We just... we were going to-"

[Line 6194] [Options Given: gaProbe_confrontAfter3:"Immediately transfer the instrument package to my ship."]

[Line 6195] [Option Selected: "Immediately transfer the instrument package to my ship."]
"Yes. Of course." 
Defeated, $heOrShe turns to an underling and says something that isn't quite picked up by the comms. "It'll be in-transit in just a moment, captain."
$HeOrShe mumbles an abashed fare-well platitude and signs off just as your logistics officer reports an incoming cargo drone.

[Line 6200] [Option Selected: Ask about the VIP transport]
"The Academy provides secure and, and discreet transport to the very, very important students who attend. These are often rich or famous families you know, and there have been..." Sebestyen looks like he's trying not to look concerned. "Threats? Maybe. You never know. So." 
He taps a datapad on his desk a couple times before deciding he should just plow ahead.
"This student is the $gaVIP_subjectRelation of $gaVIP_VIPName - that's the $gaVIP_VIPPost of $gaVIP_marketName, did you know? How exciting! Ah, and they require priority transport to $gaVIP_marketName in the $gaVIP_starName system for $gaVIP_event within $gaVIP_timeLimit days. We've been authorized an honorarium of...

[Line 6200] [Options Given: aseb_accept:Accept
aseb_decline:Decline
gaVIP_threats:"Threats?"]

[Line 6201] [Option Selected: "Threats?"]
He goes a shade paler. "Oh um. You know. Threats." 
You wait for him to elaborate. He gives in almost instantly.
"There are a lot of very bad people out there that say all kinds of things about important people and their, er, relations. And possibly, specifically, targeting a $gaVIP_subjectRelation of said family. They're usually not serious. Usually."
"...So are you still interested?"

[Line 6201] [Options Given: aseb_accept:Accept
aseb_decline:Decline]

[Line 6202] [Option Selected: Ask about the VIP transport]
"Oh." Sebestyen looks again at the datapad in his hands. "Oh! My."
The academician seems to realize what this mission entails, suddenly. "That's ... that Kanta, isn't it? Oh. Wow, well yes. The Academy guarantees discretion and security to every family that entrusts us with their young students, no matter who. Whom, I mean."
Sebestyen puts on a serious look into the middle distance, "I am proud that we stand for the principles of education and knowledge, no matter where you, or anyone, comes from!"

[Line 6202] [Options Given: gaVIP_briefingCont:Without comment, let him finish]

[Line 6203] [Option Selected: Without comment, let him finish]
He shakes his head and turns back to the datapad, "Where was- right, so the $gaVIP_subjectRelation of $gaVIP_kantaRelationFirstName Kanta - I wonder how closely they're related to the... Uh, never mind- they're a somebody at Kanta's Den. That will be priority transport to Kanta's Den in the Magec system within $gaVIP_timeLimit days. We've authorized an honorarium of, oh that's more than usual fee! $gaVIP_reward. Good, right?"

[Line 6207] [Option Selected: Continue]
They've been expecting you. Upon entering the traffic controlled volume of $gaVIP_marketName, you receive an incoming comms transmission from the offices of $gaVIP_VIPName. You arrange a dropoff point for $gaVIP_VIPhisOrHer $gaVIP_subjectRelation.
Before stepping off the transport, the young student turns back toward you and speaks.

[Line 6210] [Option Selected: Continue]
They've been expecting you. What passes for traffic control provides you a course past a field of stealth mines to enter the volume of $gaVIP_marketName. Soon you receive an incoming comms transmission from a grim boss of the Kanta dynasty, instructing you to make a drop-off for their $gaVIP_subjectRelation.
Before stepping off the transport, the young student turns back toward you and speaks.

[Line 6211] "The trip home was interminable. I don't understand at all why I should be confined to quarters during a hyperspace storm alert. Still, I believe I've learned something. Like, you know, about myself? Thank you, captain."

[Line 6212] "Travelling with you was the most terrifying experience of my life and I hope to never return to space again." A loud sigh. "But I suppose I'll have to. If I do, I hope you're the captain on my next trip."

[Line 6213] "That was amazing! Wow, I mean, that was really living, you know? I'm going to drop out of the Academy and become the captain of my own fleet..." their eyes fill with an alarming gleam of admiration, "Just like you."

[Line 6214] "Space is awful, how can you stand it? And the crew," they glance at some off-boarding spacers with disgust. "It's a good thing that lot has you to lead them and set a good example. Imagine if they were in charge! Ha- haha."

pirate kidnappers
------------------------------
[Line 6218] The pirate captain saunters into view as the comms line flickers to clarity.
"Captain! Are you in such a hurry?" $heOrShe says theatrically. "Let us talk a moment about a small matter." $HeOrShe leans in, and you can almost smell the acrid sweat and vacuum-burn. "We are here to take your very special little passenger."
$HeOrShe smiles carnivorously.
"No one will be hurt, it's a simple kidnap and ransom job. We are civilized folk, after all. It's not worth dyin' and killin' over some aristo's fancy spawn eh?"

[Line 6218] [Options Given: gaVIP_pirateRefuse:Refuse
gaVIP_pirateAgree:Agree to give up the VIP passenger
gaVIP_pirateDemand:"Only if you pay $gaVIP_piratePayment credits. Up-front."
gaVIP_pirateBluff:Bluff the pirate by saying you're working for Warlord Kanta]

[Line 6219] [Option Selected: Refuse]
The pirate captain gives you a philosophical frown when you refuse $hisOrHer terms.
"It is to be expected," $heOrShe says, "We each have a role to play in this great drama." $HeOrShe turns away from you, "Charge the guns and set the engines to full burn!" $HeOrShe turns back to you with a wild grin on $hisOrHer face, "My good captain, I shall meet you in Ludd's blackest hell!"
The comms are cut as the pirate fleet moves to engage.

[Line 6219] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6220] [Option Selected: Agree to give up the VIP passenger]
The pirate grins with merciless glee. "Excellent, wonderful! You couldn't have made a better decision, my good captain. I am so pleased we could come to an agreement."
As arrangements are made to surrender the VIP passenger to the pirate fleet, you consider how best to break the bad news to the Galatia Academy. The Persean Sector is a dangerous place, you reflect, so perhaps they will be understanding.

[Line 6221] [Options Given: gaVIP_gaveVIPtoPirateCont:Continue]

[Line 6222] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6223] [Option Selected: "Only if you pay $gaVIP_piratePayment credits. Up-front."]
The pirate gives you a scandalized look, then lets out a hearty laugh.
"Captain! I had no idea," $heOrShe says, "Your heart is so black; I am smitten, truly. Of course I agree to your terms. The sheer audacity! You would truly sell out your little sop to me?"

[Line 6223] [Options Given: gaVIP_pirateDemandConfirm:Confirm the deal
gaVIP_pirateDemandNo:"Actually, no." ]

[Line 6224] [Option Selected: Confirm the deal]
The pirate laughs again, shaking $hisOrHer head. $HeOrShe waves an arm at an underling, "The credits; see to it that my good friend here is paid their silver."
The credits come in, and you arrange for a very confused VIP passenger to be transferred via escape pod to the pirate fleet. As you refresh your credit account balance on your personal TriPad you consider the lie you'll have to use to cover for this little incident. The Academy won't be happy no matter what, so it's all down to damage control.

[Line 6225] [Option Selected: "Actually, no."]
The pirate looks betrayed and inhales, presumably to say something overwrought in response to your bold-faced turnaround, but you cut the comms before they can speak.
You order tactical to high alert. From here, it's fight or flight.

[Line 6225] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6226] [Option Selected: Bluff the pirate by saying you're working for Warlord Kanta]
The pirate reels at this notion as if struck by a Hellbore shell.
You use the moment to calmly explain how you are transporting one of the Warlord Kanta's own precious kin-folk, and it'd really be for the best if everything possible was done to facilitate the success of your mission.

[Line 6226] [Options Given: gaVIP_pirateBluff1:Continue]

[Line 6227] [Option Selected: Continue]
The bravado and theater evaporate like sunward frost. 
"Y-yes, of course. Captain." $HeOrShe struggles to regain some of $hisOrHer previous composure, "I do apologize. Profoundly. For the delay I've caused. Please," $heOrShe sweeps $hisOrHer arm in a broad gesture, "Do be on your way, and give my closest and warmest regards to t-the Warlord."
You snap the comms link off while the pirate is still attempting an awkward half-bow.

merc kidnappers
------------------------------
[Line 6231] The mercenary captain stands unmoving before you as the comms link opens. 
"Captain $playerName I presume," $heOrShe says. "I have reason to believe that you are transporting an individual associated with the notorious Kanta pirate gang. I have been authorized by $gaVIP_theMercFaction to apprehend this individual for questioning. Please surrender the passenger to my custody immediately."

[Line 6232] [Options Given: 0:gaVIP_mercWhatCrime:"What crime have they committed?"]

[Line 6237] [Options Given: 5:gaVIP_mercSendFake:Send a fake and con the merc for credits]

[Line 6238] [Option Selected: "What crime have they committed?"]
The mercenary's eyes flick off to one side and $hisOrHer jaw clenches. $HeOrShe obviously doesn't like being questioned.
"It's irrelevant. They are an associate of the Kanta pirate gang and are required for questioning. The Kantas are behind countless murders and terroristic acts, as you well know."

[Line 6238] [Options Given: gaVIP_mercHub:"So they've committed no crime. Got it."]

[Line 6239] [Option Selected: "By what authority?"]
The mercenary crosses $hisOrHer arms and you see the muscles under $hisOrHer uniform flinch unconsciously.
"By the authority invested in me by $gaVIP_theMercFaction as per the terms of the letter of marque issued to me, I am authorized to act in their interest. Why would you protect the associate of known criminals, captain?"

[Line 6239] [Options Given: gaVIP_mercHub:"So you have no warrant. Got it."]

[Line 6240] [Option Selected: "Or else what?"]
The mercenary glares at you, face unmoving, with timeless hatred. It's like staring down the barrel of a Tachyon Lance.
"You are protecting an individual with intimate knowledge of the workings of the greatest criminal empire the Persean Sector has known, captain. I suggest you do the right thing."

[Line 6240] [Options Given: gaVIP_mercHub:"Or else nothing. Got it."]

[Line 6241] [Option Selected: "Or else nothing. Got it."]
The mercenary captain looks even more annoyed than before, but manages to restrain $hisOrHer anger. "Captain. I say again, transfer the suspect into my custody immediately or face the consequences."

[Line 6242] [Option Selected: "Or else nothing. Got it."]
Finally, the dam breaks. The last you see of the merc, $heOrShe roars with anger and fist raised - then the comms link goes to static.
You turn to your officer at the communications console and confirm that the entire conversation has been recorded. As you well know, if the mercenary attacks, you are within the rights generally recognized across the Sector to defend yourself with deadly force.
The combat alert sounds. "Captain," your tactical officer says, "They're moving to attack."

[Line 6242] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6243] [Option Selected: Refuse]
The merc's lip curls into a sneer as you state your refusal to cooperate.
"Worthless ingrate. Amateur. Mudworm up-start trash." $HeOrShe spits invectives, enraged. "I'll watch you gas out in vacuum soon, I swear it." The comms snap off in a burst of static.
You turn to the officer at the communications console and confirm that the entire conversation has been recorded. As you well know, if the mercenary attacks, you are within the rights generally recognized across the Sector to defend yourself with deadly force.
"Captain," your tactical officer says, "They're withdrawing."

[Line 6243] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6244] [Option Selected: Agree to surrender the VIP]
The merc lifts $hisOrHer chin up a few degrees. "Very good, captain. I shall expect immediate transfer of the pris- passenger to my flagship."

[Line 6244] [Options Given: gaVIP_mercTransfer:Transfer the VIP to the merc's ship
gaVIP_mercPayment:"Hold on, we haven't discussed my payment."]

[Line 6245] [Option Selected: Transfer the VIP to the merc's ship]
As the shuttle leaves your $shipOrFleet bearing some obscure relative of the Warlord Kanta, you consider how you're going to break the news to the Galatia Academy.
You also try not to consider how Kanta is going to feel about the whole situation. Rumor has it she's rather protective of family, no matter how distant the relation.

[Line 6245] [Options Given: gaVIP_mercTransferCont:Continue]

[Line 6246] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6247] [Option Selected: "Hold on, we haven't discussed my payment."]
$HisOrHer head immediately levels with the display, giving a look as though you had spit in $hisOrHer face. An eyebrow raises.
"Excuse me?"

[Line 6247] [Options Given: gaVIP_mercTransfer:"I must have misspoke. Passenger transfer incoming." (back down)
gaVIP_mercNegotiate:"I require a portion of the reward for my trouble." (negotiate)
gaVIP_mercDecides:"I must have misspoke. Go suck vacuum." (refuse)]

[Line 6248] [Option Selected: "I require a portion of the reward for my trouble." (negotiate)]
Negotiating with the mercenary captain is as enjoyable as pulling teeth; $hisOrHer arrogance is simply mind-numbing. But you manage to get the merc to agree to pay you $gaVIP_mercPayment credits upfront for your release of the VIP.

[Line 6248] [Options Given: gaVIP_mercTransfer:Agree to the terms
gaVIP_mercDecides:Refuse the terms]

[Line 6249] [Option Selected: Send a fake and con the merc for credits]
Thinking quickly, you inform the mercenary captain that the passenger - a dangerous criminal, just as $heOrShe said - is being transported in a secured cargo container holding a single cryosleep unit. Therefore it will take some time to make the transfer due to the extra security arrangements you've made, but you emphatically agree that the proper authorities are best situated to bring the Kanta gang to justice.
The merc nods solemnly as you speak more of meting out justice and respecting authority. $HeOrShe gives a small salute as you sign off the comms to "personally oversee the transfer".

[Line 6249] [Options Given: gaVIP_mercCon1:Continue]

[Line 6250] [Option Selected: Continue]
Taking your hint during the comms call, your logistics officer and operations chief have already begun rigging a standard cargo container with an extra cryo pod.
As you enter the cargo bay your ops chief speaks, "Don't we need a body?"
Everyone looks at each other. No one says anything.
"Fine," the chief grumbles, "I guess this'll just have to do."

[Line 6250] [Options Given: gaVIP_mercCon2:Continue]

[Line 6251] [Option Selected: Continue]
Pod secured, your team scrambles the crypto on multiple locks: the cryopod itself, an interior crate packed into the cargo container with hastily-sprayed damage control foam, and on the heavy latches of the cargo container itself. The ruse won't hold up to sustained effort for long, but it should be enough to distract the merc long enough for you to put some light-years between you and them.
You return to the bridge having worked up a bit of a sweat, and comms the mercenary captain to inform $himOrHer that the secured prisoner will be on their way via cargo drone in just a moment. Now to the matter of the shared reward...

[Line 6251] [Options Given: gaVIP_mercCon3:Continue]

[Line 6252] [Option Selected: Continue]
Through an impressive display of flattery and feigned esprit de corps, you talk the merc into an up-front payment of $gaVIP_mercPayment credits. 
After all, as you explain, "We are knights errant to this chaotic age. It is captains like you that uphold a code of honor higher than that of mere freebooters and through armed struggle demonstrate practical virtues that might again grow in the dry heart of the outcast Persean Sector." 
The merc captain nods emphatically to your words. Your TriPad pings behind your back as incoming funds are automatically accepted.

[Line 6252] [Options Given: gaVIP_mercCon4:Continue]

[Line 6253] [Option Selected: Continue]
Your dealings completed, the merc offers not even a smile, and says "Burn bright, captain. I shall see you again soon, I hope."
Your nav officer begins to disengage your $shipOrFleet from the mercenaries at a leisurely burn, following previous orders.

[Line 6253] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:"I am sure it will be an unforgettable meeting. Comms out."]

betrayed Kanta, fleet that shows up
------------------------------
[Line 6258] "Captain $playerName I presume," the mercenary commander says coolly. $HeOrShe knows who you are, of course. 
"The Warlord Kanta sends her regards."
$HeOrShe nods an order to some underling, then moves with unhurried contempt to close the connection.

[Line 6258] [Options Given: gaVIP_revWhy:"What's this about?"
gaVIP_revTrick:"Good, you're here."
cutCommLink2:"I'll see you in hell. Save a place for me when you get there."
cutCommLink:Say nothing]

[Line 6261] [Option Selected: "What's this about?"]
The mercenary commander actually looks indignant, raising a hand to halt what you presume is the attack order.
"You sold out one of Kanta's kin. But"- $heOrShe grinds out, with apparent difficulty- "you forgot about it? There must be no greater fool than you in the entire Sector."
The comm link snaps closed before you have a chance to respond.

[Line 6261] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6262] [Option Selected: "Good, you're here."]
Thrown off-guard by your reaction, $heOrShe struggles to regain the initiative, "No, you're to be made an example- " 
You interrupt and explain that you're working for Kanta- deep undercover. Who would be foolish enough to sell the Warlord's kin without her express instructions? You don't even want to speculate how they angered the Warlord, but what would the Kanta clan be without a firm hand at its head? 
In fact, you're on your way to carry out the second part of this task- the less said the better. And, you glance idly at a datapad, it is $hisOrHer fleet, right on time, which is to provide resupply at this stage of the operation.

[Line 6264] [Option Selected: "What else would she say, given that the fact of this "betrayal" is public knowledge?"]
$HeOrShe pauses, eyes flickering back and forth as if trying to read your face for a bluff. Thinking. "I think... I see now. If we fought, the winner would receive updated instructions. Conditional messages hidden in comm systems." It's working. "I've heard stories about the Warlord arranging these kinds of... tests."
You keep quiet, letting $himOrHer talk $himOrHerself into it.
"-And whoever prevailed would be well supplied, whether the supplies are handed over or picked from the wreckage. They would be the better captain. More aggressive; more ruthless. A stronger fleet."

[Line 6265] "But that's me, isn't it?" $HeOrShe grins, and it's not a pleasant thing to see as this ruse takes an unexpected turn. "I am curious about what this mission is, but I suppose that'll have to wait until after you're dead."
You find yourself staring at static as the comm link is abruptly terminated. Your comms officer gives you a sympathetic shrug.

Sebestyen quickly skims his datapad. "This one is pretty standard, it's just... well, the research outpost on $gaOp_planetName is pretty remote I guess? That's why the $gaOp_department Department wants a, uh, an expert like you to handle transport."
"Yes, so $gaOp_planetName is in the $gaOp_systemName system, about $gaOp_dist light-years away." The academician pauses for a moment, thinking about just how far away this is.
"Um. Right, you just need to drop off the half dozen or so researchers. They have budget for, oh, $gaOp_reward credits as payment. What do you think?"

You order a scan of the coordinates provided by Academician Sebestyen and a faint power source is detected. Your comms officer transmits a coded greeting to the position, receiving confirmation from a friendly transponder, and you open contact with the small, hidden research outpost operated by the Galatia Academy.
The research team you've brought to this lonely planet is quickly transported to the surface by shuttle. The leader of the outpost thanks you and says, "Please give our regards to Provost Baird. We, ah, appreciate this opportunity she's given us to-", $gaOp_leaderHeOrShe licks $gaOp_leaderHisOrHer lips, considering $gaOp_leaderHisOrHer words.

No stable power source is detected. Comms attempts to transmit the coded greeting provided in Academician Sebestyen's mission package, but there is no transponder response. You order an active-sweep of the surface; this is a less subtle approach which can reveal search targets to nearby ships, but you deem this an acceptable risk.

[Line 6278] [Options Given: gaOp_destroyedCont:Continue]

[Line 6279] [Option Selected: Continue]
A pirate raid destroyed this outpost. An observation drone reveals specimens and material scattered between the main airlock and landing pad. It looks like everything of value was looted and the hab bulkheads breached and vandalized. Members of the research team are nowhere to be found; the lack of bodies is hopeful, at least. You order the complete site survey attached to the encrypted mission file.

[Line 6280] [Option Selected: Continue]
Pathers hit this outpost, and not too long ago from the looks of it. An observation drone reveals that research equipment was piled outside the base and slagged by a combination of explosives and hand-weapons. Any useful supplies have been looted. One poor soul- the research lead, judging by the nearby ID fob- is found executed in the central annex amid scrawled Pather slogans. You shut off the grim display once the relevant site survey is complete.

[Line 6281] [Option Selected: Continue]
A massive energy discharge seems to have destroyed the primary laboratory space from the inside. Drifts of hot radioactive debris are spewed outward like the fingers of a malevolent hand. There are no survivors. With readings like this, you reflect that even if you did find any of the bodies they would have to be collected by drones and placed in lead-lined caskets.

[Line 6282] [Option Selected: Continue]
The outpost was hit by an orbital strike by someone with access to fairly heavy weapons, judging by the still-cooling lava at the bottom of the crater. A single stray telemetry repeater from some piece of equipment thrown by the blast remains operational, ticking away a null data set into the night. You order detailed scans of the site attached to the mission file, though you can't see what value they might have.

[Line 6283] [Option Selected: Continue]
The outpost is completely abandoned for no reason you can ascertain. You send an observation drone to do a first sweep, then a hazardous ops salvage team. All find the outpost is pristine, eerily silent. All data cores have been triple-wiped. A meal remains uneaten on the common mess table. The research team you've transported refuses to shuttle down, and after some consternation, they agree to take full responsibility for their decision. You order the salvage team quarantined until your techs give them the all-clear.

[Line 6284] [Option Selected: Continue]
Investigation by observation drone reveals a reasonably intact research outpost, though unresponsive to comms. It turns out to be totally powered down. One suited but helmetless corpse outside the airlock appears to have been the lead researcher. Investigation by your hazardous ops salvage team - armed on this occasion - reveals that a series of bizarre murders took place here, with no survivors remaining. Your salvage teams enact strict quarantine procedures despite finding no anomalous chemical or biological agents. The research team you've transported refuses to shuttle down and their leader demands to be returned to the Galatia Academy.

[Line 6285] There is nothing to do but return the disheartened researchers to the Galatia Academy along with the data you've collected on the outpost site.

Your comms officer transmits a coded signal to the coordinates provided by the Galatia Academy and you receive transponder pingback.
A comms-link is established, allowing you to exchange greetings with the leader of the outpost. They seem eager to become your friend, and an invitation is extended to share a meal with the research team leads. It all feels rather false to you but experience with the Galatia Academy has taught you that these academics' careers depend upon fostering networks of influence.
After confirming the details of the shuttle flight down, you exchange pleasantries and close the channel.

"It was just as though the AI had a sudden change of- of heart, I guess," they explain, haltingly. "It used the phrase 'omega function progress' several times. I don't know what that means."

Some minutes later, your comms officer is repeating attempts to re-open the comms-line while sensors run an active scan of the outpost site. "$PlayerSirOrMadam!" - it's comms, "We have a transmission from the surface."
You recognize the research lead from their distress call, looking somewhat more haggard than before. "Captain! Thank the stars, it's- I think it deactivated itself. This isn't some trick again, is it? No, this- you're too... different. I- I have to believe you're real."

An armed salvage team is dispatched to the surface to secure the AI core and rescue the outpost's research team- they have no interest in staying after what has happened. Besides, the crux of their research is being loaded into a shielded cargo crate as you debrief them. 
The lead researcher is thankful for rescue, but refuses to explain why an AI core was active in their base. Repeated statements of "I take full responsibility." is all you get.
There is nothing to do here but return them to the Galatia Academy. 
Discreetly.

[Line 6317] [Option Selected: Perform an orbital strike to destroy the AI despite any human cost]
The research outpost is small, unfortified, and totally lacking countermeasures. But you know that if an AI like this is given a fair field of battle- well, best not to worry about that right now. A swift, thorough orbital strike is the only way to be sure. Those scientists were dead the moment that AI got loose. Perhaps even before; the moment they signed on to experiment on a living AI core.
Your stone-faced tactical officer prepares the attack pattern.

[Line 6319] [Option Selected: Load the arranged shuttle with marines to verify the situation, then capture or destroy the AI]
You order the pre-arranged shuttle packed with marines and weaponry. There's no telling what sort of electronic warfare the AI is capable of, so this operation will be run radio-silent, using only point-to-point tightbeam comms.
The shuttle descends, sending back only normal telemetry, the pilot speaking only routine call-and-response. After landing, all comms go quiet. Your sensors officer picks up a few flashes of light, a cloud of dust, some EM-spikes. There's no way to know exactly what is happening down there until it is all over.
Several minutes tick by on the operation timer. Audio on the pre-set comms frequency hisses static.

You personally oversee the transfer of the shielded cargo container carrying what remains of the AI core to a secure hold. 
The lead researcher is thankful for rescue, but refuses to explain why an AI core was active in their base. Repeated statements of "I take full responsibility." is all you get.
There is nothing to do here but return the whole lot to the Galatia Academy.

"We um, there's a bit of a problem with your mission file. It seems like," his eyes focus on something- no, someone- just out of view of your display.
He gives the smallest of nods to this other party, then turns his attention back to you, "All of the data was irreparably erased. And I cannot emphasize enough that the Academy considers this matter highly sensitive and," he starts reading off a datapad, "-all intellectual property, novel methods, patented devices, and other means observed in the course carrying out this mission are deemed highly confidential."

"Just talk to the contact, make arrangements, and return the $gaBA_item to the Galatia Academy. Simple!" The academician taps his datapad on his desk contentedly. 
"Oh right, and there's a mission reward of $gaBA_reward credits. Just," he leans in, looking concerned, "you'll want to be careful. Space pirates. I've ... heard things." He shakes his head, as if dismissing these concerns "But you'd be fine, right?"

[Line 6341] The comms signal struggles to establish through the ill-maintained local network. Patchy decryption artifacts glitch spasmodically to resolve into the face of the Pather contact.
"Blessings of Ludd be upon you," $heOrShe says, looking you over suspiciously.
You can't quite place the accent, but it seems flattened toward the Sector mean from something unfamiliar. An import from an obscure Luddic colony? Or one of those lost souls that drifts into the Persean Sector from time to time, frozen in cryosleep?
Unnerved by your pause, the Pather speaks again. "You contacted me, $playerBrotherOrSister. Is there - something - you are looking for?"

You haggle, argue, and stall by quibbling over payment and delivery details. While speaking, you give the ready-signal via datapad to your tactical officer who has been briefed for the use of marines in an extraction operation.
You consider that no matter the criminality of your contact, there may be serious reputation consequences with the local authorities for starting a firefight within this polity.

You switch the display to the tactical feed from your marines just as they report success.

The Pather nods, relieved, and says, almost to $himOrHerself, "Doing it like this will do more good than destroying some evil trinket." $HeOrShe looks up through the display with a fanatic's eyes once more, "I won't thank you, captain, but I hope the stars lead you to Ludd's Path." 
$HeOrShe considers, "Someday." The comms go black.

$HeOrShe clenches a fist and stops $himOrHerself. "I understand. We all have a spiritual connection to the Creator, and though a tool of-" $HeOrShe stops $himOrHerself again, "-a tool, I will respect that you want to carry out an honest deal."
$HeOrShe sighs. "To the letter. So, as agreed, $gaBA_costNormal credits?"

The Pather takes in your threat for a moment, then replies wearily, "So you could captain, and I would be but dust returned again to the stars."
$HeOrShe looks up, and says "This is punishment. For my hubris, and for my pride. And by the Creator, I deserve it."
"Captain. Let us come to a resolution. If I receive no payment for this thing you want so badly, then I'm as good as dead anyway. I can go no lower than $gaBA_costVeryLow credits."

The Pather nods, relieved, and says, almost to $himOrHerself, "Doing it like this will do more good than destroying some evil trinket." $HeOrShe looks up through the display with a fanatic's eyes once more, "I won't thank you, captain, but I hope the stars lead you to Ludd's Path." 
$HeOrShe considers, "Someday." The comms go black.
Your logistics officer reports a shipping pickup ping from a local craft guild's logistics concourse. A neatly packaged crate bearing a logo for the Galatia Academy and only a few scorch-marks is soon on board your flagship.

"$BrotherOrSister, you misunderstand the situation entirely!" you say, letting warmth fill your voice. "We walk the Path together." 
A look of panic crosses the Pather's face, but you quickly reassure $himOrHer that you're not here from the Knights - you're here to help.
"But how?" asks the Pather, near tears.

[Line 6353] [Options Given: gaBA_bluffPather1:Continue]

[Line 6354] [Option Selected: Continue]
It's simple.
You are a deep-cover Pather agent infiltrating the den of Moloch, gaining trust, but laying deep plans for long-term sabotage that could "... bring down the spiritual carcass spreading its rot throughout the Sector!" you explain in a voice that grows louder, filling with the fervor of a dockside preacher.

[Line 6354] [Options Given: gaBA_bluffPather2:Continue]

[Line 6355] [Option Selected: Continue]
You explain that although $heOrShe has sinned egregiously here, it must have been just one more step on the Path. Your part is to take this technological artifact off their hands, subtly spoil its daemonic workings, then return it to the Galatia Academy. The fools will pay you, further funding the Pather movement.
"As for you," your voice takes a dark turn. You explain that even if the result is good, this trespass, this sin - the selling of technological artifacts - must be atoned for. You expect deep devotion to the cause from here on out, and the way to do that would be, first, to accept $gaBA_costVeryLow credits as payment, and second, to imply to $hisOrHer fellows that you may be a double-agent who truly serves the Path and therefore should not be harassed by raiders.

The Pather nods as you speak, a new-found purpose growing in the ruins of $hisOrHer traitorous revelation moments before. "I will do as you ask. Blessings of Ludd be upon you!"
You raise your hands and make the sign of the Path to match the gesture of the fanatic before you, then you terminate the comms.
Within seconds your logistics officer gets a ping from the logistics bay of a local crafts guild. A crate containing the Galatia Academy's technology package is soon on board your flagship.

[Line 6359] The comms signal struggles to establish through the ill-maintained local network. Patchy decryption artifacts glitch spasmodically to resolve into the face of the pirate contact.
"I prefer to think of myself less as a pirate and more as a facilitator," $heOrShe explains after you perform a perfunctory greeting. "There will always be an underworld. Imagine the chaos if there were no guide to assist you in navigating these dark storms and eddies." 
$HisOrHer slow smile reveals diamond teeth. "How can I guide you today?"

You haggle, argue, and stall by quibbling over payment and delivery details. While talking, you give the ready-signal via your datapad to your tactical officer. They have already been briefed for use of marines in an extraction operation. 
Regardless of the crimes of your contact, there are likely to be serious reputation consequences with the local authorities for starting a firefight within this polity.

[Line 6364] A thud and a bang carry through the pirate's commline as the image goes fuzzy for a moment. $HeOrShe looks back at you, eyes wide with panic, "You conniving clone-of-a-" 
The comms go dark.
You switch the display to the tactical feed from your marines just as they report success.

[Line 6366] [Option Selected: Accept and pay $gaBA_costHigh credits]
"I am so very pleased that we could come to an agreeable conclusion," the pirate says. "My people will arrange for a cargo transfer at once," $heOrShe turns away, stops mid-gesture, and looks back at the display.  "And captain? I am so sure we shall do business again, very soon."
The comms image freezes on the pirate's diamond smile, dissipates halfway into a hacked Tri-Tachyon holding pattern, then blackness.
Your logistics officer reports a shipping pickup ping from the local traders' concourse. A neatly packaged crate bearing a logo for the Galatia Academy (and only a few embedded jags of stray shrapnel) is soon on board your flagship.

The pirate $personLastName is taken aback, "Why captain, perhaps you're new to how things are done around here. We all have an angle- what's yours?" $HeOrShe puts a finger to $hisOrHer chin in pretended contemplation, "A no-nonsense, straight-shooter, come to carry out the deal by the letter. You'll see the Sector put right in no time!"
$HeOrShe gives a mocking look, and sighs. "Just this once, perhaps. $gaBA_costNormal credits will do. And it's because I admire your idealism." 
You suspect $heOrShe doesn't. Before you can respond, $heOrShe claps $hisOrHer hands and addresses you full-on once more: "Accept my revised offer captain, or leave us both disappointed."

The pirate's face freezes in a somewhat forced, you think, smile as $heOrShe glances at someone off-screen and gives a little shake of the head.
"Oh, you're simply wonderful, captain! And you're right," $heOrShe says, sweating now, "You're bringing such business to our humble end of this Sector we all share, and I can appreciate that. The ransom credits? A formality- you understand, I can't simply give the package away. Imagine what my other customers would think! A token amount is all I ask, to maintain appearances. $gaBA_costVeryLow credits would prove to all that you don't need charity, then you can be on your way. I need to make some space in my warehouse anyway."

"Wonderful!" $heOrShe says, looking relieved. "My people will arrange for a cargo transfer at once. Ah- look at the time. I must be going. Pleasure's all mine I'm sure." 
The line cuts off abruptly, and mere moments later your logistics officer reports a shipping pickup ping from the local traders' concourse. A neatly packaged crate bearing a logo for the Galatia Academy- and only a few minor indentations from stray shrapnel- is soon on board your flagship.

You laugh, as though the pirate has told a hilarious joke. $HeOrShe looks confused at first, but in moments can't help but join in - if there's a joke, it seems that $heOrShe simply can't stand to not be one of those who is in on it.
Wiping away a tear, you compliment the audacity of raising the price so blatantly, and observe that you would expect no less from a successful professional. Particularly when dealing with spineless academics, who wouldn't know how to make a deal even if they had an equation that explained it for them.

"We, of course, are different animals," you explain as you smile ruthlessly back at the pirate.
$HeOrShe quickly comes around to the idea that you're an up-and-coming force, and if they want to stay relevant they're going to have to foster a good working relationship to ensure... viability.
The first step toward a brighter future is, naturally, reducing the proposed ransom to something more reasonable, like $gaBA_costVeryLow credits. It's important that money exchanges hands to signal a willingness to do business, but to ask too much would be a poor investment "In our future as business partners," you explain.

The Academician realizes with a start that he's become rather sidetracked. He picks up his datapad and squints, "Uh, where was I?"

In this case they're demanding $gaRR_costNormal credits, which we'll release to you so you can pay the pirates' contact. Um, and their name is $gaRR_contactName, and they can be found $gaRR_onOrAt $gaRR_marketName." 
"We'll give you their comm code so all you have to do is sneak into the port somehow, contact $gaRR_contactName, pay the ransom, then return Academician $gaRR_researcherName here to the Galatia Academy for an honorarium of $gaRR_reward credits."

Judging by the sudden illumination of his face, Sebestyen has pulled up a thick block of legal text, which he proceeds to scroll rapidly for a minute or so, speed-reading legal clauses.
"Well, technically," he smiles brightly, "the funds are released to you as 'working capital appropriated to hiree' - that's you - 'pursuant to recovering deliverables listed in addendum A'.

Between you and me, their understanding of theory is a bit loose at best, so there can be... misunderstandings.

------------------------------
[Line 6427] The comms open on a Knight of Ludd bearing the handweave and wooden sigil of a knight-captain. "Blessings of Ludd be upon you," $heOrShe says, looking you over with obvious suspicion. $HeOrShe nonetheless maintains a civil tone.
"How may I serve, $playerBrotherOrSister?"

[Line 6428] [Option Selected: Ask about a certain prisoner associated with the Galatia Academy]
"Ah, you're from the Academy. Or not quite- they hired you, is that right?" $HeOrShe gives you just a glance, "It is."
"First, I would like to assure you that the individual on whose behalf you are petitioning the Knights has been treated well, though considering their crimes, has been confined to a guest dormitory and had technological privileges... limited."
The Knight flips a page in some kind of real-paper notebook, reading. "I see here that this academician was caught with a number of... devices, 'research equipment', they say. These devices have been destroyed." $HeOrShe looks up to see how you react, then nods to $himOrHerself.

[Line 6429] [Option Selected: Ask about a certain prisoner associated with the Galatia Academy]
"You're here on behalf of the Academy. You, who appear to wish to count yourself among the Faithful." $HeOrShe does not look impressed. "You walk a treacherous Path, $playerBrotherOrSister."
$HisOrHer eyes turn down toward some kind of real-paper notebook, "Accept now my assurance you that the individual on whose behalf you are petitioning the Knights has been treated well. Though considering their crimes, has been confined to a guest dormitory and had technological privileges... limited."
The Knight flips a page, eyes scanning the text. "I see here that this academician was caught with a number of devices, 'research equipment', they claim. These devices have been destroyed." $HeOrShe looks up to see how you react, then nods to $himOrHerself.

[Line 6430] [Option Selected: Continue]
"We understand the need for stable relations between our respective institutions," $heOrShe says, "and the mother Church has emphasized this point very precisely to our order. Excubitor Orbis Oak has agreed to waive the usual procedures in place of a generous donation to the Church."
"I trust you have brought the Academy's silver?" $HeOrShe gives just the hint of a wry smile.

[Line 6430] [Options Given: gaRR_acceptChurch:Pay $gaRR_costNormal credits for the academician's release

[Line 6431] [Option Selected: Pay $gaRR_costNormal credits for the academician's release]
The $post nods. "You may transfer the credits to the port exchanger. Just tell them the sum is to be delivered to the Knights of Ludd."
You nod, and motion for your logistics officer to take care of the transaction.
"Which leaves us with your wayward academician," $heOrShe sighs. "We shall have them escorted to the outsiders' concourse immediately for your pick-up."

[Line 6431] [Options Given: gaRR_acceptChurch1:Continue]

[Line 6432] [Option Selected: Continue]
The Knight claps $hisOrHer notebook shut. "-Which concludes our business," $heOrShe says, and pauses as if considering $hisOrHer words. 
"I will pray for you, captain. And please, prevail upon the Academy to be more... considerate. Providence guide you."

[Line 6432] [Options Given: gaRR_acceptChurch2:Continue]

[Line 6433] [Option Selected: Continue]
You dispatch a shuttle to pick up the released academician. Once on-board, they appear in good health and once away from the brooding Knights of Ludd, complain bitterly about lost data- "Those fanatics smashed my new TriPad. Simply barbaric! And it can't be my imagination, but I suspect that they hardly bathe down there."
You nod politely and motion for your security chief to escort the academician to their quarters so you can avoid them on the long trip back to the Galatia Academy.

[Line 6433] [Options Given: gaRR_acceptChurch3:Continue]

[Line 6435] [Option Selected: Negotiate to avoid paying]
"$BrotherOrSister," you begin, a touch of the cadence of a concourse-preacher you once heard coming to you as if from nowhere, "I feel like you don't fully approve of what is happening here."
Before the Knight can object to you prying into business not your own, you raise a hand to gently stop $himOrHer. You explain that you understand that it is not your place to ask why they are in this position, but as a fellow member of the faith, you empathize with the moral struggle of having to answer to both the institution and one's own God-given conscience.
You speak softly, building rapport with Knight $personLastName, who is nodding now. Truly, you explain, it is tragic that tawdry worldly affairs tarnish the beautiful spiritual journey mapped out by the prophet Ludd - but such is the fallen world.

[Line 6435] [Options Given: gaRR_negotiateChurch1:Continue]

[Line 6436] [Option Selected: Continue]
"That's just the thing, $playerFirstName. I- that is, we- anyone, really, is caught between higher ideals, the transcendent glory that drives us to rise above all of-" a violent hand motion "-this! ... And the spiritual compromise required to exercise even a measure of power in this world. With the office comes power to do some good, I realize, but." $HeOrShe sighs deeply, looking off to the side.
"But with that good also comes evil, and each time this... I feel it eat away at my soul, just a bite. But after years and years, who have I become? When it is my day to join the stars, will I be the $manOrWoman who once was filled with the light of Creation, who was so inspired to swear to serve as a Knight of Ludd?"
"Or will I hold an accounting-book filled with my own cowardly compromises at the end? Heavy enough to weigh down my soul." $HisOrHer face hardens as $heOrShe comes to some decision.

[Line 6436] [Options Given: gaRR_negotiateChurch2:Continue]

[Line 6437] [Option Selected: Continue]
With a sweep of the arm, the knight throws the paper notebooks from $hisOrHer desk. You wince at this treatment of a genuinely hand-crafted object. "Hear this, captain: I won't allow myself to sink into slow spiritual death by these whispering wormwood corruptions. Was not Ludd a martyr!?"
Knight $personLastName looks directly at you, with fire in $hisOrHer eyes. 
"Take this researcher. Tell them of when Ludd freed the prisoners, tell them of mercy, and of how the sacred can be found even in those who seem most lost." $HeOrShe stands, and jabs a key on a battered console that was spared $hisOrHer burst of wrath.
"Blessings of Ludd be upon you, $playerName. Now I have work to do." The comms shut off.

[Line 6437] [Options Given: gaRR_negotiateChurch3:Continue]

[Line 6438] [Option Selected: Continue]
You are left unsure of how you feel about inspiring this newfound conviction by way of your admittedly modest deception. Your logistics officer clears their throat and motions to the main display- a passenger request pickup has been received from a small shuttle bay. Your wayward researcher.
A shuttle is dispatched, returning with the flustered academician. All that remains is to return them to the Galatia Academy.

talking to contact - researcher ransom pirate version
------------------------------
[Line 6441] The comms signal struggles to establish through the ill-maintained local network. It takes seconds for the patchy decryption artifacts to spasmodically resolve into the face of the pirate you were instructed to contact.
You perform a perfunctory greeting, and the pirate smiles without warmth. "Ah, you're here for the Academy's lost child. We shall both be pleased to see the last of one another," $heOrShe rolls $hisOrHer eyes, "-it's the questions! So many questions."

[Line 6442] The pirate claps $hisOrHer hands and looks back to you with all the eagerness of a lamprey. "You have my money, yes? $gaRR_costHigh credits, to my comms ID, and you can have your big wet scientist back."

[Line 6442] [Options Given: gaRR_acceptPirate:Accept the higher amount and pay $gaRR_costHigh credits

cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 6444] [Option Selected: Keep $himOrHer talking while you send a marine raid]
You haggle, argue, and stall by quibbling over payment and delivery details. While speaking, you give the ready-signal via your datapad to your tactical officer. They have already been briefed for an extraction operation. 
Regardless of the particular crimes of your contact, there are likely to be serious reputation consequences with the local authorities for starting a firefight within this polity.

[Line 6444] [Options Given: mktRaidNonMarket:Continue]

[Line 6445] A thud and a bang carry through the pirate's commline as the image goes fuzzy for a moment. $HeOrShe looks back at you, eyes wide with panic and anger, "You conniving clone of-"
The comms go dark. You switch the display to the tactical feed from your marines just as they report success.

[Line 6447] [Option Selected: Accept the higher amount and pay $gaRR_costHigh credits]
The pirates' fingers slither over a datapad as $heOrShe confirms the credits transfer.
"Very, very good," $heOrShe says without looking up, "You'll find your friend in the box."
The comms snap off.
Your logistics officer reports a pickup ping from a seemingly abandoned loading bay. You fear the worst as you dispatch a small shuttle to make the pickup, but you do indeed find a very unhappy academician of the Galatia Academy sealed in a crate with a small life-support unit. Given food, rest, and a shower, they'll be fine.

[Line 6447] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6448] [Option Selected: "That wasn't the deal." (confront)]
The pirate $personLastName reels back a half-step, looking hurt. "That wasn't- captain, captain. Are you new to this? That must be it." The pirate produces a long, wheezing sigh.
"I can see you're just going to make trouble over this. It isn't my job to educate you in how the world works out here, and if this is how you act, you're going to have a," $heOrShe looks you over, and sneers, "-a long, painful education."
"So. I give up. Let it be $gaRR_costNormal credits then, I don't care. Take this screeching egg-head away, I beg you."

[Line 6448] [Options Given: gaRR_acceptPirate:Accept and pay the original ransom of $gaRR_costNormal credits

gaRR_threatenPirate:"Or I trace your comms and reduce your compound to slag." (threaten)]

[Line 6450] [Option Selected: "Or I trace your comms and reduce your compound to slag." (threaten)]
The pirate's eyes go wide. $HeOrShe quickly glances to someone off-screen and gives a little shake of the head, then returns $hisOrHer attention back to you.
"Rude. Just rude. You would threaten me with this? Here?" the pirate stomps back and forth, "You don't know who I know. I know pirate-bosses that will chew you up into little pieces. You have no idea who I work for."
"$gaRR_costVeryLow credits. If you can't pay that much, then I might as well throw myself out the airlock now. At least I'll go in one piece. My bosses wouldn't be so kind."

[Line 6450] [Options Given: gaRR_acceptPirate2:Accept and pay the smaller ransom of $gaRR_costVeryLow credits
cutCommLinkNoText:Decline and cut the comm link
gaRR_preRaidPirate:Decline, but trace the comms for a target for a marine raid]

[Line 6451] [Option Selected: Accept and pay the smaller ransom of $gaRR_costVeryLow credits]
The pirates' fingers slither over a datapad as $heOrShe confirms the credits transfer.
"You'll find your friend in the box," $heOrShe says without looking up again. 
The comms snap off.
Your logistics officer reports a pickup ping from a seemingly abandoned loading bay. You fear the worst as you dispatch a small shuttle to make the pickup, but you do indeed find a very unhappy academician of the Galatia Academy sealed in a crate with a small life-support unit. Given food, rest, and a shower, they'll be fine.

[Line 6451] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Continue]

[Line 6452] [Option Selected: Negotiate a lower amount]
You laugh, as though the pirate has told a hilarious joke. $HeOrShe looks confused at first, then with growing anger and disgust at being left out of some joke.
Wiping away a tear, you compliment the audacity of raising the price so blatantly, and observe that you would expect no less from ruthless space-scum of $hisOrHer caliber. Particularly when dealing with shiny-clean academics, who would get lost on the way to the head if they didn't have their datapad to lead them.

[Line 6452] [Options Given: gaRR_bluffPirate1:Continue]

[Line 6453] [Option Selected: Continue]
"We, of course, are different animals," you explain as you smile ruthlessly back at the pirate.
$HeOrShe quickly comes around to the idea that you're an up-and-coming force, someone willing to do what it takes. And if they want to stay relevant, they're going to have to foster a good working relationship with you. Wouldn't want to end up spaced out of several different airlocks, right?
The first step toward this brighter future is, naturally, reducing the proposed ransom to something more reasonable, like $gaRR_costVeryLow. It's important that money exchanges hands to signal mutual respect, but to ask too much would be a poor investment "In our future as business partners," you explain.

[Line 6453] [Options Given: gaRR_bluffPirate2:Continue]

[Line 6454] [Option Selected: Continue]
You order the much smaller payment of $gaRR_costVeryLow to the cowed pirate who can barely tear $hisOrHer eyes from $hisOrHer cracked datapad until the incoming credits can be confirmed.
Your logistics officer reports a pickup ping from a seemingly abandoned loading bay. You fear the worst as you dispatch a small shuttle to make the pickup, but you do indeed find a very unhappy academician of the Galatia Academy sealed in a crate with a small life-support unit. Given food, rest, and a shower, they'll be fine.
The pirate speaks, relieved to see you've confirmed that the kidnapped academician is alive, "Captain, I'm-"

[Line 6460] "Ah, uh, captain." Sebestyen stammers awkwardly at you for a moment. "T-The, um, bursar's office contacted me, and um, they're taking back the credits allocated to you for the ransom payment. They tell me that the situation has been resolved?"

[Line 6463] "Provost Baird put in a request for the extraction of a, um, researcher? From er ... a heavily guarded Tri-Tachyon black site in the outer Sector. Also I'm not supposed to tell you where it is before you accept the mission." Sebestyen looks up at you awkwardly, "For reasons." 

[Line 6464] [Options Given: gaTJ_start:Ask about the Tri-Tachyon black site extraction mission]

[Line 6465] [Option Selected: Ask about the Tri-Tachyon black site extraction mission]
"Yes! Okay." Sebestyen clears his throat nervously.
"The provost said I shouldn't... um, I can't tell you the location of the target system until after you accept. So." He trails off, and re-aligns the datapad on his desk, as if that might help. Everything set to order, he has no choice but to continue speaking.
"This mission requires... discretion. As I'm sure you know, there are many - technically - unclaimed systems outside the core worlds. If some polity were to make an official claim, they'd have to establish a charter and, well, this would - technically - give the Domain jurisdiction. Of course without the Domain around, the Hegemony has claimed successor status and has therefore stepped into the role of..."

[Line 6465] [Options Given: gaTJ_briefing1:Continue]

[Line 6466] [Option Selected: Continue]
Sebestyen notices you drifting. 
"I'm sorry captain, what I mean to say is that the Tri-Tachyon corporation considers the site in question to be outside the jurisdiction of, er... anyone. And it is therefore within their rights to establish ah, a secret research base. And defend them however they see fit. The Hegemony disagrees."
"And so um," Sebestyen pinches his eyes shut for a moment, "They hire these mercenaries and, and they shoot anything that comes near. It's terrible!"

[Line 6466] [Options Given: gaTJ_briefing2:"Watch out for mercs, got it. The mission?"]

[Line 6467] [Option Selected: "Watch out for mercs, got it. The mission?"]
"Oh! I was just getting to that. Well, the previous provost, Tomas Kallichore, he worked closely with Tri-Tachyon. There was some pretty exciting research, actually, and... sorry, the mission: an academician from the Galatia Academy is still stationed at one of these secret research bases and... Provost Baird wants them back."
"But this academician was never there in the first place, technically. Legally speaking. Because it was all a big secret."
Sebestyen looks pained at the logic of these politics, "So Tri-Tachyon isn't, um, cooperating. Do you see?"

[Line 6467] [Options Given: gaTJ_briefing3a:"You want me to kidnap a researcher from a secret Tri-Tachyon base?"
gaTJ_briefing3b:"You want me to 'rescue' a researcher from a secret Tri-Tachyon base?"]

[Line 6468] [Option Selected: "You want me to kidnap a researcher from a secret Tri-Tachyon base?"]
"No no no, it's not kidnapping!" Sebestyen seems sick at the thought, "The researcher wants to come home, $gaTJ_heOrShe managed to get some communications out and we've set up a whole system... er."

[Line 6469] [Option Selected: "You want me to 'rescue' a researcher from a secret Tri-Tachyon base?"]
"Yes, exactly!" Sebestyen seems relieved at your understanding. "The researcher wants to come home, $gaTJ_heOrShe managed to get some communications out and we've set up a whole system... er."

[Line 6470] Option(s) Selected: ['gaTJ_briefing3a'];['gaTJ_briefing3b']
He looks around, "Please, don't tell anyone I told you that part. Um. So if you can help, Provost Baird has insisted that you receive $gaTJ_reward credits. I'm authorized to provide more information if you accept."

[Line 6471] [Option Selected: Accept]
"Wonderful," Academician Sebestyen looks relieved.
"The research base is on the planet $gaTJ_planetName in the $gaTJ_systemName system, which is $gaTJ_dist light-years from here."
"You'll want to avoid the, er, mercenary patrols. We believe they'll be guarding all of the jump-points, so if you can find a large gravity well to jump to, that could get you safely in-system. Then go to where the research base is hidden and contact Academician $gaTJ_researcherName through the coded frequency that I'll provide. $gaTJ_HeOrShe should be able to shut down the base's security for long enough to get aboard your ship."

[Line 6471] [Options Given: gaTJ_briefing5:Continue]

[Line 6472] [Option Selected: Continue]
Sebestyen re-reads his datapad with a concerned look, then adds "There's... a way to get back to hyperspace without using a jump-point. It might be useful." 
He looks up at you, perhaps wondering if you'll think him insane, "It's not a joke. Before the Hegemony arrested so many of our top hyperspace researchers after the, ah, big incident, one of them - Academician Scylla Coureuse - was working on this theory, and we were very close to finding an application for a sort of Transverse Jump which could move a ship directly to hyperspace from normal space." 
He puts down the datapad, looking worried, "Theoretically."

[Line 6473] [Options Given: gaTJ_briefingHaveTJ:"Oh, I know how to do that."]

[Line 6474] [Options Given: gaTJ_briefing6:"That sounds useful." ]

[Line 6475] [Option Selected: "Oh, I know how to do that."]
"You- what?" Sebestyen looks stunned, processing your statement.
"I suppose, of course... There were rumors, anecdotes... um, do you mind providing some of your navigational logs? The data would be quite fascinating and, and..."

Academician Sebestyen sits up a little straighter, "Yes! I'll transmit all the necessary information, captain. Good luck." 
He puts down, then picks up his datapad. "And please be careful," he adds.

gaTJ planet interactions

[Line 6481] Your $shipOrFleet approaches $entityName. There is no outward sign of a Tri-Tachyon research base. 
"Captain," your sensors officer brings your attention to a cluster of weak neutrino sources in the southern hemisphere. "Wouldn't have caught it if we didn't know what to look for."

[Line 6482] A nearby hostile fleet is tracking your movements, making a rescue operation inadvisable.

Almost immediately a worried face appears, dripping sweat. "Stars beyond," $gaTJ_heOrShe exclaims, "You actually came! I am Academician $gaTJ_researcherName and I'm ready to leave. Right now." 
$gaTJ_HeOrShe laughs, sounding just a little unhinged, "It's been - rads and ruin, a long long time. I've pulled a copy of all the base archives, and," $gaTJ_heOrShe grins and holds up a small datachip, "The little secret Baird wants so badly. The EMP is about to go off, so don't panic when you detect it. I've hidden a shuttle in a shielded bay and I'll meet you in orbit soon. Just remember- " 
A frantic alarm sounds behind $gaTJ_himOrHer. The researcher looks over $gaTJ_hisOrHer shoulder, "Ludd's hells-" 
The signal cuts out.

[Line 6484] [Options Given: gaTJ_contact2:Continue]

[Line 6485] [Option Selected: Continue]
The EMP goes off like a flashbulb on your bridge holodisplay of the planet below. All stations set to high alert, you wait tense minutes for any sign of Baird's informant.
"There!" shouts your tactical officer.
The bridge display zooms in to a small energy source that just made low orbit - a tiny cargo shuttle without even a closed cockpit. Visual scans can just make out a suited figure riding on its light chassis, weak thrusters pushing a course toward intercept.

A space ops team ushers the freed academician into a debriefing chamber. "Captain," $gaTJ_heOrShe says with panic in $gaTJ_hisOrHer eyes, "There's no time. They got a signal out before the comms went down. I've got this," $gaTJ_heOrShe fumbles with a pouch on $gaTJ_hisOrHer vacuum rig, pulling out the datachip from earlier.
"It's a software patch. Roots and modifies hyperdrive field software. Then, on command, you can engage Transverse Jump. Jump from normal to hyperspace," a manic gleam comes into $gaTJ_researcherName's eyes, "Anywhere."

[Line 6489] [Option Selected: "No need. I already know how to do that."]
"You... what?" $gaTJ_researcherName looks at you, confused. "I've heard rumors. Just spacers' stories, I thought. There's no way you could tune the hyperdrive field that accurately on manual control. And if you made one mistake..." 
$gaTJ_HeOrShe shakes $gaTJ_hisOrHer head, forlorn in the conclusion that $gaTJ_heOrShe has been rescued by a captain whose primary reactor is missing some shielding.
You take the datachip from $gaTJ_researcherName's trembling hand. Provost Baird wants this thing, so she'll get it. You order the academician to be seen to quarters - and watched - as you return to the bridge to decide whether to Transverse Jump directly to hyperspace or deal with the incoming mercs the old-fashioned way.

[Line 6489] [Options Given: defaultLeave:Leave]

[Line 6490] [Option Selected: Take the datachip]
You take the datachip from the escapee's trembling hand.
"Yes, yes," $gaTJ_researcherName says, "Use this and we can escape. Those mercs, captain, they're the expensive ones. No mere pirates, they're... " $gaTJ_heOrShe shudders, "They're cruel. And they have the best ships money can buy. You have to get us out of here."
You order the academician to be seen to quarters - and watched - as you return to the bridge.

[Line 6490] [Options Given: gaTJ_investigateChip:Investigate the datachip]

[Line 6491] [Option Selected: "That won't be necessary."]
A look of fear crosses the escapee's face, "Captain! But you must. Please, just take it," $gaTJ_heOrShe moves forward, trying to push the datachip into your hands. And freezes as your bodyguards' sidearms appear.
"The merc fleets- they'll be coming for you now," $gaTJ_researcherName pleads. "They won't negotiate, captain. You have to get us out of here," 
You wave your bodyguards down and take the chip. Provost Baird wants this thing, so it must be worth something. You order the academician to be seen to quarters - and watched - as you return to the bridge.

[Line 6491] [Options Given: gaTJ_investigateChip:Investigate the datachip]

[Line 6492] [Option Selected: Investigate the datachip]
As your $shipOrFleet prepares to de-orbit, you plug the datachip into a secure terminal to see what Provost Baird decided to risk your life for. It is encrypted, of course, and the routine ICE-breaker doesn't crack it. Rarely does, but one must be thorough.
You think for only a moment before inputting the secure comm frequency given to you by Sebestyen to contact this 'researcher'. The crypto unfolds, leaving you with a tiny code package that seems to want to interface with a standard Domain hyperdrive kernel. You call your navigation officer over to consult.

"It appears to 'tune' the hyperdrive field," they explain. "And if this does what it says it does, it would be able to create the effect of a sort of pseudo jump-point around the ship itself." The excitement in their voice is palpable, "Theoretically an entire fleet could launch itself into hyperspace from ... anywhere!" 
You react without surprise to this development, thanking the officer for the input.
"Um, yes, $PlayerSirOrMadam," they say uncertainly. "I'll return to my station and await your orders."
You upload a copy of the datachip's contents to your personal TriPad. Just in case.

[Line 6495] "Captain! Thank you for returning- " Sebestyen freezes, then lowers his voice, "-for returning the ah, researcher. Provost Baird will be very pleased. She's restarting the hyperspace- um, well, I shouldn't ruin it. I'm sure there'll be a proper announcement when they're all ready."

[Line 6500] [Option Selected: Establish a colony]
Your sensors officer frowns at a blinking indicator. "Captain, there appears to be a faint signal coming from low orbit."
They pull a detailed scan of the transmission source to the primary bridge display, an orbital nav grid overlaid with icons and telemetry.
"The transmission is very weak. We only picked it up as the survey array ran through its calibration cycle. It looks like an automated instrument package deployed in low orbit. Power source is degraded. It's got to have been here for a while."

[Line 6500] [Options Given: gaIntro2_start2:"And the signal?"]

[Line 6503] [Options Given: gaIntro2_retrieval2:Order the data core retrieved]

[Line 6504] [Option Selected: "And the signal?"]
Your sensors officer activates the audio output: a garbled loop, wailing in and out of coherence. A recorded voice? 
"The transmitter must be damaged. But with a little work," a hint of pride enters their voice, "There."
"-ment of the Galatia Academy. If found, I implore you to return the data core to the academy for a reward of 18,000 credits authorized by Provost Tomas Kallichore. Message will repeat."

[Line 6504] [Options Given: gaIntro2_retrieval:Order the data core retrieved
gaIntro2_leaveIt:Leave it be]

[Line 6507] [Option Selected: Order the data core retrieved;['gaIntro2_retrieval2']]
Your ops chief oversees a retrieval mission by-the-book, staging approach-and-scan to maximize safety in the event of environmental or technological hazards. The salvor team is used to your chief's attention to detail and within the hour place the instrument package data core in an EM-sealed crate.

[Line 6507] [Options Given: gaIntro2_inspect:Inspect the data
gaIntro2_leaveWithCore:Just take the core]

[Line 6508] [Option Selected: Inspect the data]
Cursory inspection by your technology officer - to make sure this isn't some kind of bomb or rogue AI core - reveals a data core packed to its limit with compressed telemetry streams. 
"It's a... a lot of data," they say, scrolling through vast columns of numbers.

[Line 6508] [Options Given: gaIntro2_what:"What is it?"
gaIntro2_leaveWithCore:"Good. Then the Academy will pay me for its recovery."]

[Line 6509] [Option Selected: "What is it?"]
"Well," your technology officer's brow furrows, "Recordings. Sensor logs. Detecting, um." They pause the data-feed, examining some of the numbers. "Some kind of... field strength?"
You are beginning to get the impression that your tech officer doesn't know what this device was measuring.

[Line 6509] [Options Given: gaIntro2_sayso:"If you don't know, just say so."
gaIntro2_leaveWithCore:"Good. Then the Academy will pay me for its recovery."]

[Line 6510] [Option Selected: "If you don't know, just say so."]
"$PlayerSirOrMadam. Yes, of course." Is that the hint of a blush? The reprimand is made, so you push no further.

[Line 6511] [Option Selected: "Good. Then the Academy will pay me for its recovery.";['gaIntro2_sayso']]
It doesn't matter what's on this data core, corrupted or not, so long as the Galatia Academy pays the credits promised for its return. You order the crate secured in the cargo hold until your $shipOrFleet next finds itself in the Galatia system.

[Line 6515] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnStart2:Ask about returning a datacore to Provost Kallichore]

[Line 6516] [Option Selected: Ask about returning a datacore to Provost Kallichore]
At the mention of "Kallichore" the junior agent goes suddenly pale and touches their ear, stammering something about an urgent request as they turn and leave.
With a sigh, you check the public comms terminal nearby. No entry under the name "Kallichore". After your query, the display locks into a Hegemony COMSEC warning.

[Line 6516] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnStart3:Continue]

[Line 6517] [Option Selected: Continue]
You open comms to your flagship and delegate the task of finding out what's going on to your comms officer.
In short order they manage to navigate the lower echelons of graduate students to finally speak with someone in a position of authority. 
The active comms link is routed to your personal interface.

[Line 6517] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnElek1:Accept the comms request]

[Line 6518] [Option Selected: Accept the comms request]
"Academician Elek, at your service. Captain... ?"
The academician draws out your presumed title like you've forgotten to serve him biscuits with his tea. You're certain your comms officer would have mentioned your name.

[Line 6518] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnElek2a:"I've recovered a data core. The provost authorized a reward."
gaIntro2_returnElek2b:"My name is $playerName. I'm returning a data core for the provost's reward."
]

[Line 6520] [Option Selected: "My name is $playerName. I'm returning a data core for the provost's reward.";['gaIntro2_returnElek2a']]
"Oh, one of those. Of course. Your secretary should have just said so." The academician pauses, "But then this would have been Provost Kallichore, would it not? He's not the provost anymore, no no." 
Elek's voice deepens with practiced gravitas, "Not after what happened..."

[Line 6520] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnElekWhat1:"What happened?"
gaIntro2_returnElekStillReward:"So is there still a reward?"
gaIntro2_returnElekDumpIt:"Is there a reward or should I dump this data core into this gas giant we're orbiting?"
]

[Line 6521] [Option Selected: "What happened?"]
Elek leans back, slipping into his professorial role. "The provost - Kallichore that is - quite overstepped the bounds of his office, in my opinion. The Hegemony agreed cracked down rather dramatically. Oppression and tyranny ran rampant in the halls of enlightenment! Troopers stomping down the corridors of our fine academy, can you believe!"
"Now, I'm a mere specialist in the planetary sciences - some would say preeminent in my field - so of course I had nothing to do with Kallichore's jump-point experiments. But." He pauses, taking a moment to look up to the heavens.
"I had my suspicions. Particularly of those amongst my colleagues who wouldn't hesitate to breach the ethos we uphold as members of this academy. And that's exactly what I told the Hegemony officer who interrogated me! The thick-headed brute said he'd review my list of names, but per my observations I speculate that he quite ignored my insight. It is as stars tossed in the mud, I tell you! I present the gift of knowledge and-" 

[Line 6521] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnElekWhat2:Continue]

[Line 6522] [Option Selected: Continue]
Elek rambles away, giving you no clear answers about what happened.
Instead, Academician Elek seems to have a list of complaints against his colleagues, the Hegemony officers who didn't cooperate in Elek's efforts to sell out his colleagues, and against both the previous and current provost, neither of whom holds - or held - a correct appreciation for 'The Academy'.
You sigh, and use your captain-voice to pry a few words into a pause as Elek is finally forced to take a breath.

[Line 6522] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnElekStillReward:"Let us discuss the reward."
gaIntro2_returnElekDumpIt:"Is there a reward or do I dump this data core into the gas giant we're orbiting?]

[Line 6523] [Option Selected: "Let us discuss the reward."]
"Oh." Elek looks at you blankly for a moment.
"I suppose there is that. Hmm, I don't recall that particular account being frozen. Have your secretary or whomever send the data core to the Planetology Department, if you would be so kind."

[Line 6523] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnElekReward:Send the data core over]

[Line 6524] [Option Selected: "Is there a reward or do I dump this data core into the gas giant we're orbiting?]
The edge in your voice seems to shake the academician. 
"Oh." Elek looks at you blankly for a moment. "Please! Don't do that, the data is very valuable. Which, um, I suppose there is a reward. That account wasn't frozen, after all. Have your secretary or whatever send the datacore to the Planetology Department, if you would be so kind."

[Line 6524] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnElekReward:Send the data core over]

[Line 6525] [Option Selected: Send the data core over]
You would, and you do. 
Academician Elek authorizes release of the reward credits to you, via the bursar's office, with surprising alacrity.

------------------------------
[Line 6529] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnSebStart:DEV return the core to Sebestyen]

[Line 6530] "Captain!" Sebestyen looks pleased to see you. Come to think of it, he always seems pleased to see you. 
"I'm told you recovered, um," he taps at something on his desk. "This um, oh, the data core. That project belongs to... here it is, Academician Elek in planetology." 
Far be it from Sebestyen to criticize anyone directly, you detect an unusual drop in positivity in Sebestyen's tone when referring to this 'Elek'. It's not that he's being unkind, just... less kind.

[Line 6530] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnSeb2:"The reward is still good?"
gaIntro2_returnSeb3:"What's wrong with Academician Elek?"]

[Line 6531] "Captain!" Sebestyen looks pleased to see you. Come to think of it, he always seems pleased to see you. "I'm told you recovered, um," he taps at something on his desk.

[Line 6532] [Option Selected: "The reward is still good?"]
"Oh yes, of course," Sebestyen says. "There was a separate account allotment for data recovery rewards budgeted into the project's, um, budget. So regardless of who is, um, the current provost or not, you are set to be paid. I just need to send this form, and-" he taps his desk interface decisively.
"Done. The funds should be released to your account now. Good find, captain!"

[Line 6532] [Options Given: contact_pickAnotherGreeting:Continue]

[Line 6533] [Option Selected: "What's wrong with Academician Elek?"]
"I, uh." Sebestyen is caught by your directness. "...Academician Elek?"

gaIntro2_returnSeb2:"Never mind. The reward is still good?"
]

[Line 6534] [Option Selected: "I get the impression that this person isn't universally liked."]
"I, uh," Sebestyen begins, then speaks more quietly, "Of... it, it isn't appropriate for me to speak poorly of any of the faculty of this institution. Being of course that I'm the liaison for Provost Baird's special, um."
He trails off, then tries a new tack.
"It's important that I be aware of the sensitivities of individuals within the academy, of course. And without. And how they might feel about... well, Academician Elek. He might be described by some - not me, of course - as having an, um." 
Sebestyn reaches for a dark place within his psyche to find the words, then says "An off-putting manner."

[Line 6534] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnSeb5:"Off-putting? That's it?"]

[Line 6535] [Option Selected: "Off-putting? That's it?"]
"I mean." Sebestyen looks troubled. "Yes? Of course the individuals who feel, um, off-put don't see it as a small issue at all, which complicates the liaising between the uh, departments in question."

[Line 6535] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnSeb6:"I'm sorry that Elek makes your job more difficult."
gaIntro2_returnSeb7:"How much do you hate Elek?"
gaIntro2_returnSeb2:"So how about that reward?"]

[Line 6536] [Option Selected: "I'm sorry that Elek makes your job more difficult."]
"Please, captain," he says. "You don't need to apologize. My job is to liaison, and Provost Baird picked me because I, I exceed expectations!" 
Sebestyen seems to surprise himself a bit with this self-assessment and, steeling himself, proceeds. "I can deal with Elek, don't worry. It is after all," he looks into the middle distance, jaw tight, "My job."


[Line 6536] [Options Given: gaIntro2_returnSeb2:"So how about that reward."]

[Line 6537] [Option Selected: "How much do you hate Elek?"]
"Um." Sebestyen turns a new shade of red. "Of course I don't, uh, I wouldn't use such a strong word with regard to... how about that reward for recovering the data core? $gaIntro2_credits credits, wasn't it?" 
He starts tapping desperately at his interface.

A pack of young officers relax, downing a higher tier of drinks amid rolls of laughter at one or another bon mot.
One of them glances at you, his head turning just a degree as recognition crosses his face. He calls out, lifting a drink.
"Ah, you there! $playerName, is it not?"
He puts on a glowing smile and approaches. His friends examine you, elbowing one another as if this is the set-up to some jape.

"One hears you've won not a few skirmishes with pirate scum and the like. In service to the Hegemony, hear, hear!" He raises his glass in a partial salute.
Then he looks to each side, performatively checking for snoops, before leaning in to speak more quietly, "One even hears that old man Daud himself invited you for a personal meeting. Didn't get any of that mozzie hive-dirt on you did he? Ha-ha."

"Come now," he says with a wounded look. "It's a grand old tradition to grumble about the top brass. I'm simply having a bit of a laugh with a new friend of mine. And-" he speaks louder now, "And a new friend of the Hegemony, from bottom to top!"
His entourage cheers to this.

[Line 6554] [Option Selected: Continue]
"We are all but comrades-in-arms, you and I. But where are my manners? Caspian Sang, reporting for duty." He half-salutes with his drink again, the liquid in the glass approaching but not quite escaping the rim. You catch one of Sang's drinking companions snickering, though it is unclear who the target is.
"Although..." He puts a finger on his chin, pantomiming deep thought, "...perhaps I should count you as, at best, an auxiliary comrade. Does your Hegemony commission pay splendidly well? No need to answer of course, friend. It is the business," this word he emphasizes, "of none but yourself."
"And old man Daud, of course," he adds with a wink.

[Line 6556] [Option Selected: "The pay is irrelevant. I stand for the Hegemony."]

[Line 6557] [Option Selected: "I win battles for you lot. The pay is so you feel like you're helping."]
Sang's face is overcome with shock and delight; he's found one that fights back. He clutches his chest as if stabbed, his drinking companions hooting and calling at your riposte.
"Where did you come from, captain?" he says, flicking spilled drink from his off-hand, "Ludd curse me but the Hegemony can use such talent."

"I tell you what, I have just the notion." He decisively quaffs his drink, then proceeds.
"A most spectacular notion. In light of Daud's declaration that you're as much an officer as us, it would only be proper to provide you an opportunity to share an anecdote or two of your wisdom with the cream of the navy, don't you think?"
"House Rao - surely you know the family - is holding the grand ball of this season on Eventide. I shall place your name upon the guest list by invitation of the humble House Sang. Now does that not sound absolutely first-rate? You'll be the talk of the season, I'm sure of it."

[Line 6578] Your shuttle follows a course to the surface authorized by the datakey attached to your invitation to the grand spring ball of Eventide.
You watch as the sprawling spires and annexes of House Rao's spring manor rise on the horizon from a fertile, protected valley. The battlements of vast storm clouds stream beyond distant ridgelines by some quirk of geography which channels airflow around this eye of calm.

[Line 6578] [Options Given: soe_houseRao2:Continue]

[Line 6579] [Option Selected: Continue]
Your shuttle descends through shafts of light reflected from orbital mirrors. You observe that on this occasion the Raos have arranged for artful placement of the mirrors to provide dramatic mirrorsets in several vistas viewable from the manor.
Upon landing you are intercepted and greeted by a human servitor in a crimson and silver house uniform. Your pilots and bodyguards, meanwhile, are directed toward a utilitarian waiting area stocked with ample refreshment.

[Line 6579] [Options Given: soe_houseRao3:Continue]

[Line 6580] [Option Selected: Continue]
You are led to a bulbous lift with no visible control interface. As soon as the doors close, it begins a smooth ascent toward the spires of the manor while the servitor makes soothing inquiries about your trip. 
There is no perceptible change in subjective gravity as the lift accelerates upward; the agrav plates here are very finely tuned indeed.

[Line 6580] [Options Given: soe_houseRao4:Continue]

The servitor whisks you past soaring windows blazing with the light of mirrorset to a grand set of doors. They signal for you to wait for just a moment, following some opaque choreography of the event. Within a minute, it is your time. 
The grand doors swing open with the silent gravity of the celestial spheres, sweeping you into the ballroom of House Rao.

[Line 6582] [Option Selected: Enter the ballroom]
"$playerName," your name rings through the great hall. A brief pause, then "Commissioned auxiliary officer of the Hegemony Navy."
A few heads turn to take you in. There, a dismissive brow raise, there a too-quick flick of the eyes. The attendees seem little bothered to match your name to a face.
Resplendent brass of the Hegemony Navy dominate the crowd, though there are a smattering from the Legion as well as the various ministries spun off from the naval hierarchy.

[Line 6583] [Option Selected: Continue]
Less overt but as numerous are civilians in suit, dress, and robe that generally but not as a rule evoke the martial character of Hegemony rule. Despite the political climate, you even recognize the characteristic fashions of several other major factions, religions, and independent megacorporations; diplomats, business execs, holo-actors, priests, and even a cluster bearing the garb of tenured Galatia Academy academicians.
Now you can get to doing what you came here for.

Your eyes roam over the crowd, looking for the push and pull of influence. You note the figures of vast power moving through the space, attracting satellites and disturbing orbits. There, a space marshall of the reserve fleet; there, the prime executor of Eventide's planetary government. There, the chief operations officer of a major military contractor.
"$PlayerSirOrMadam." A human servitor interrupts your train of thought, offering a tray filled with delicate glasses of something effervescent.

He's just left his pack of social remorae and is already on an approach vector. Noticing you notice him, he instantly deploys a grin of dubious conviviality.

[Line 6594] [Option Selected: Take a glass]
"Why captain," Caspian Sang oozes up to you. His uniform is as newly pressed and his smile as insincere as at your last meeting. "I see you've already found your commission payment," he indicates your untouched beverage, "The bounty of our fine hosts' noblesse oblige so soon plundered, eh."
You smell the spirits on his breath as he continues to speak. "But I give you too little credit. You serve the Hegemony, do you not? Give a little show of it now and pass me the top-up, will you?"
Over Caspian's shoulder you see his gang of minions tittering.

[Line 6595] [Option Selected: Wave them away]
"Why captain," Caspian Sang oozes up to you, nearly emptied glass in hand. "I would expect a commissioned pirate - my apologies, privateer - to start by plundering our fine hosts' noblesse oblige." 
He offers his drink to you, "Please, take mine." You can smell the spirits on his breath. "Do your duty to the Hegemony and fetch me a top-up."
Over Caspian's shoulder you see his gang of minions tittering.

"Yes, captain, you have." The cruel spark in Caspian's eye grows. "By showing up. It was a test, you see, and you failed. You don't know your place. Not yet."
He licks his lips. This is just the opening salvo.

[Line 6609] [Option Selected: Punch his stupid face]
Caspian is caught completely off guard as you land a solid blow. He trips on his uniform's scabbard and topples to the ground.
A widening circle of the crowd has gone silent; now they are all looking at you.
He looks up at you looking like a cornered animal, giddy in fear and delight. "You just made such a mistake, $playerName," he says quietly, wiping blood from his nose.

A woman in the uniform of a Hegemony commander appears, already looking at Sang with suspicion.
 
"Lieutenant Sang, was it?" Without shifting her focus she tosses a cocktail napkin at him. "I see you've been welcoming a new arrival to my family's celebration."
As Sang fails to catch the napkin you can almost see his bully's instincts grappling with the new social dynamic in play.
She nods politely to you. "Commander Neriene Rao. And if I recall correctly, you are Captain $playerName?"

[Line 6610] [Options Given: soe_introNeriene2a:"I am. It's a pleasure to meet you."

A woman in the uniform of a Hegemony commander appears, taking the center of attention, and speaks with a voice lifted to the crowd of onlookers.
"Lieutenant Sang, was it? I see you've been welcoming a new arrival to my family's celebration with your usual charm."
A polite wave of laughter from the onlookers breaks the tension. They start to turn back to their conversations. You can see Caspian's face turning red as his bully's instincts grapple with the new social dynamic.
She nods politely to you. "Commander Neriene Rao. If I recall correctly, you are... captain $playerName?"

Neriene faces you, cutting Caspian out of the conversation.
You watch in your peripheral vision as he realizes what's been done. He scuttles back toward his minions. The joking is over. They look at you now with sneering hostility.

"That boy," she says, "is a weak-willed fool who believes that he must tear down others to build up himself." 
She looks you over, "And it would seem that he chose a poor target this time around. And even had he not, I expect someone would have to shoot down his little game before he made much more of a scene."
She sighs, "There's the family name to think of, after all."

"Caspian Sang is a fool and he deserved that," she says with a frown, "But striking an officer won't endear you to the others. It's also technically illegal, but if you follow my lead nothing should come of it. Sang is not the sort to endure well the shame of filing such a report."
"Besides," she says, looking around, "It might offend the family."

[Line 6619] [Option Selected: "Why are you covering for me?"]
She catches your eyes for a moment, then looks back toward the crowd. "Because... I thought it might be interesting."
"Anyway, the family has a reputation for a rebellious streak and I'd be remiss not to uphold it."

"Yes. Yes, we are. Absurd, isn't it?" She looks a little sheepish, "I mean, it's home. But this, this palace? In the face of everything going on out there?"
She looks up, past the mirrorset illuminating the grand windows of the ballroom. "We're supposed to be rebuilding the Domain, aren't we?"
"Maybe we are," she adds darkly.

soe_danceStarting1b:"Does Admiral Orcus Rao agree with you?"]

[Line 6621] [Option Selected: "House Rao. As in, Admiral Orcus Rao, the Hero of Raesvelg."]
"Oh yes, Granduncle Orcus." She smiles, revisiting some old memory.
"No one can believe he got away with everything he's gotten away with. But if, like him, you've got the dumb luck to walk out of disaster alive again and again - and better yet, you deliver victory in the darkest days of war - they'll let you get away with anything."
She considers a moment, then adds, "Almost anything. It's gone to his head a bit though, I think."

"Look at them," she says. "All these fancy people puffing each other up, all smiles and high ideals in public. Once they're behind closed doors, it'll be plotting and backstabbing and spreading rumors."
"I could never stand how two-faced it all is. Grandmother says to take it personally is childish, that it's just how politics is done." She twitches as if to cast off a bit of dirt.

As Neriene begins to reply, you find the crowds in the ballroom withdrawing toward the sides of the room. During your exchange with Sang, you must have missed some announcement because the live band at the end of the great hall is beginning to play a waltz.
Dancers partner up from the edge of the floor. You catch a glimpse of Sang and his flunkies keeping an eye on you, still held off by the force of Neriene's presence.
You look at her for some kind of cue. She looks at you expectantly.

Jeers and laughter come from the direction of Sang's minions, but they're ignored easily enough as you turn your back on the ballroom.

You are slow to follow at first, not being accustomed to ballroom dancing with the elite of Eventide, but Neriene is patient and accommodating, providing instructions on the local customs in a low voice.

She is quick to follow, though you suspect not accustomed to that role.

Your acceptance washes across the crowd, waking them as if from a stupor. Their murmuring fills the hall. Cardona, Sang, and the rest gather and begin walking toward a tall set of doors at one end of the ballroom. Others join them, mostly officers, mostly young men.
"Grandmother!" Neriene calls out; you follow her pleading look to a stately woman overseeing the entire affair. "Put a stop to this, there's no need for bloodshed on this night."

On a bench before you lies a dueling kit: hardened boots, gloves, and helmet. A neatly folded jumpsuit of material smart enough to allow only what it judges to be non-lethal jabs and cuts comes with a suite of embedded medical sensors to automatically perform first-aid upon injury. "Deaths are very rare," a minor aristocrat assures you as he hands a scabbard to Neriene Rao.
She waves him back toward the gawkers with an annoyed look. There are fewer gathered around you, and fewer uniforms, than those egging on Cardona and Sang.
"This is stupid," she says, drawing the sword a handswidth and examining the edge. "You don't have to go through with it."

[Line 6683] [Option Selected: "I won't have them think me a coward."]
Neriene sighs, "It doesn't matter what those children think. I just can't believe grandmother is allowing this to go on. Emboldening people like Cardona is going to cause trouble."

[Line 6684] [Option Selected: "What do you mean by people like Cardona?"]
"It's, um. Complicated. Political." She doesn't like to talk about it, you think. 
"There are those in the Hegemony that think they - we, I mean; those whose families came from the officers of the Fourteenth Battlegroup - that we're somehow better than everyone else. It's ridiculous."

[Line 6685] [Option Selected: Just take the sword]
She hands you the scabbard with the sword, "This was given to me by my father." 
"But it doesn't have any sentimental value." She gives you a quick look, "I never cared for swordplay."

[Line 6686] [Option Selected: "Charming traditions you have here."]
"One that has no place in a civilized society," she says. "But I suppose we aren't quite that, are we."
She looks toward one of the mirrorsets.

Neriene looks doubtful as she hands you the scabbard. 
You draw the blade in a single movement and demonstrate a lunge or two. The crowd gathering around you cheers and call boasts toward the other end of the loggia.
"Those idiots might have made a bigger mistake than I thought," she admits with an impressed look.

[Line 6688] [Option Selected: "I'm ready to fight."]
"If you're sure," she says.

[Line 6690] Option(s) Selected: ['soe_duelPrepLeave']
The crowd jeers. Neriene gives the closest hecklers a killing look; they quickly discover that they were less enthusiastic about this duel than they had thought. Her status as a member of House Rao and host of the ball does not shield you from general disdain, however, and she quickly leads you through a discreet servants' access lift and back to your shuttle's pad.

The staff is efficient; your entourage is summoned without requiring your intervention, though they seem to have been interrupted in the middle of a meal, wiping hands and one guard popping an anti-inebriant.
Shuttle prepped, Neriene sees you off from the launch pad.
"Well," she says uncomfortably, "I apologize for... for everything. We're not all clannish brutes."

You find yourself lifted onto the shoulders of excitable revelers who were not your friend only minutes ago. You are carried bodily back into the grand hall, where pressurized potables are uncapped.
Placed at the head table like a king, you are presented to those gathered as some kind of cult-object, the avatar of victory, honor, or some other notions that will likely make a lot less sense tomorrow when everyone sobers up.

The thought crosses your mind that Neriene's sword is no longer in your hand. You hope someone ensured that it was safely stowed. You catch sight of Neriene's face; she is trying to push through the crowd. She looks at once joyful and concerned.
Augusta Rao looks on from afar, her expression aloof.

Later - how much later you don't care to consider just yet - you stand unsteadily before your shuttle. The manor staff are efficient; your entourage has been summoned. Some look like they've been woken from sleep, and you note one guard stealthily popping an anti-inebriant. They keep their tone professional, but you can tell that they are glowing with pride. Word of your victory obviously spread quickly through the waiting flight crews.
Neriene appears to see you off from the launch pad. She is well composed despite the excesses of the ball.
"You've made some friends tonight," Neriene says with a hint of a smile, which fades. "And some enemies."

soe Lost Duel

[Line 6715] You slowly awaken. You feel distinctly unwell; there is no pain, but instead the wrongness of separated flesh. 
A portable automedic beeps beside you, cold tubes running into your body. A vaguely Neriene Rao-shaped figure asks you something.

You're leaning against a bench, you think, with someone's uniform jacket behind your head. Tall windows glow in the twilight, the blurred forms of revelers moving within.

She gingerly leads you to a discreet servants' access lift and back to your shuttle's pad.

"Comms open," $heOrShe does a double take. "$PlayerName. Captain."
"Your $shipOrFleet has been associated with anomalous hyperspace maneuvers," $heOrShe says as if reciting an intel report. "We'll have no such indiscretions today."

The comms resolve to show $personName, who brings $hisOrHer hands together in greeting.
"Blessing upon you. What may I-" $HeOrShe squints,"Forgive me, I should have recognized the $shipOrFleet of $playerName."
$PersonName looks uncomfortable. "There have been troubling reports concerning certain hyperspace maneuverings. I pray that no such performance may be witnessed in this local volume. Some might consider it a... blasphemy."
Remonstration delivered, $heOrShe puts $hisOrHer hands together. "How may we serve?" 

[Line 6735] After a short wait, your connection request is accepted.
"Bright stars and long burns." $HeOrShe looks you over, "Ah, I know it. $PlayerName! I've heard stories- leaping to and from hyperspace with nary a care." $PersonName grins, "Magnificent. I'd ask you to show me how, but ya'know. In my position, I can't take risks like I used to."
$HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head, then says "So how can I be helping?"

[Line 6736] After a short wait, your connection request is accepted.
"Salutations captain," $heOrShe glances at you, then away, then back again in earnest. "Captain $playerName! Why, are you not the one hopping to and fro across hyperspace? Of course you are!"
Then, more to $himOrHerself, $heOrShe says "My stars, this should provide a diverting anecdote."
$personName looks to you impatiently. "Well do go on, $playerSirOrMadam. My attention is yours."

"This is $post $personName." $HisOrHer eyes flick over you as a small frown forms.
"Captain $playerName, I see. Let there be no irregular hyperspace antics on my watch, $playerSirOrMadam. Consider that an official request."

[Line 6738] After a short wait, your connection request is accepted.
"Welcome, captain!" $PersonName smiles broadly, "One hears things about you. Flitting across the hyperspace boundary and the like, allegedly. One only imagines the profits that could be made by an enterprising trader who could dodge tariff patrols at the flick of a switch." 
$HeOrShe winks quite blatantly, then switches gears. "So what legitimate business brings you here?"

[Line 6739] After a short wait, your connection request is accepted.
"Yes, what? I'm in the middle of," $heOrShe looks at you with a shock of recognition.
"Oh! I am by nature a skeptic, but I have had it on some authority that you've managed a technique with which to leap to and from hyperspace without engagement with a Durand-Patel conjunction." $HeOrShe thinks for a moment, "I'll only believe it when I receive sensor logs. In triplicate."
$personName starts tapping at buttons, lost in thought. You think it best to begin your inquiry before $heOrShe becomes more distracted.

[Line 6740] After a short wait, your connection request is accepted.
"$PlayerName, of course it would be you." $HeOrShe grins carnivorously, "Rumor has it you've been jumping to and from hyperspace with little regard for the positioning of jump-points." $PersonName wags a finger at you, "Naughty, naughty. Whatever will the authorities think?"
"Naturally I bear no criticism of your cleverness," $heOrShe continues magnanimously, "Let me welcome you to my humble orbit as a... kindred spirit."

$HeOrShe interrupts your attempt at a greeting with a quick wave, "I'm sorry, captain, is it? I don't mean to be abrupt, but I really need to secure a delivery of $proCom_quantity units of $proCom_commodityName as soon as possible." 
$HeOrShe hesitates, sighs, then says "I'm willing to pay above market value, $proCom_pricePerUnit per unit. If you're interested."

"Finally, someone reasonable." $HeOrShe pulls you aside as if you're old business partners, and says quietly "I'm looking for $proCom_quantity units of $proCom_commodityName. Delivered here, as soon as possible, don't care how it gets done so long as it gets done, understand? I'm willing to pay $proCom_pricePerUnit per unit, isn't that generous?

$HeOrShe raises two fingers at the bartender, "I need $proCom_quantity units of $proCom_commodityName delivered to $proCom_marketName. $proCom_dist light-years away.

$HisOrHer cool smile returns just as the bartender arrives with two small, potent drinks. "Do we have a deal?"

"One of our agents infiltrated a militant Luddic sect $extr_marketOnOrAt $extr_marketName." $HeOrShe meets your eyes, "Yes, Pathers. We know our agent was apprehended. Extraction by any means necessary is now our mission objective, and I believe you are best suited to carry out this mission." $HeOrShe sighs, "We cannot use the flagged navy in this operation due to... religious considerations. So we come to you. Retrieve the agent and we will pay you $extr_reward credits."
With a few taps at $hisOrHer console you receive an incoming data stream, "Intel on the Pathers' defenses. We won't be sending you in blind, at least."
You quickly review the intel and estimate that you'd need around $extr_marines marines to carry off this operation.

interaction with target market
------------------------------
[Line 7003] You feel a twitch through the agrav plates as the assault shuttle docks. You nod your approval to the medic and marines escorting the rescued agent - they return a salute. The agent is too dazed to recognize you as their savior. 
No matter.

[Line 7004] The extracted agent, bloodied but alive, is escorted to secure quarters by a medic and two guards. 
Curses and impotent oaths of vengeance come in over the comms. You nod to your comms officer, who terminates the open channel.

[Line 7005] The extracted agent, exhausted, alive, and in need of a long shower is escorted to secure quarters by a medic and two guards. 
Curses and impotent oaths of vengeance come in over the comms. You nod to your comms officer, who terminates the open channel.

[Line 7006] [Option Selected: Take a shuttle down to visit a dockside bar]
The shuttle makes its final approach to the port district, the pilot overseeing small pings of attitude thrusters.
Your comm link chimes. An incoming request appears - an encrypted voice-only connection from source unknown.

[Line 7006] [Options Given: extr_pickUp:Accept the connection request
extr_ignore:Ignore it and head to the bar]

[Line 7008] [Option Selected: Accept the connection request]
You accept the comm request. A voice crackles from the staticy display of your TriPad.
"Captain $playerName. I know why you're really here. I believe you and I can resolve this situation personally, though I must remain anonymous due to political considerations."
"I recognize that your capability to employ deadly force is not insignificant. I wish to propose a path of least bloodshed."
"You will have to trust me, captain. And, naturally, I cannot simply give you what you want; it will come at the price of $extr_storyCost credits. I hope you find this an acceptable compromise, given the alternative."

[Line 7008] [Options Given: extr_storyOption:Cooperate with the voice and pay the credits
extr_ignore:Close the connection and head to the bar]

[Line 7009] [Option Selected: Cooperate with the voice and pay the credits]
The voice provides you with a numbered burner account for the credits transfer. 
"Excellent, captain," the anonymized  voice says, "I confirm receipt of your payment. From this point it'll take only a short time for the arrangements to be made."
The voice gives you instructions to head to a particular bar, $extr_barName, near the concourse. "Goodbye, Captain $playerName," it says one last time.
With the sinking feeling that your target - and credits -might be further away from you with each passing minute, you enter the bar.

[Line 7009] [Options Given: extr_continue1:Continue]

[Line 7010] [Option Selected: Continue]
The proprietor looks up as soon as you step into the dim tube-lit interior. "Hey!" You tense, at the tone. "You can't just let your friend sleep here, I'm not running a hotel yeah?" This must be $extr_barOwner.
$extr_barOwner pulls you toward a dark end of the bar where a figure appears to be passed out drunk; a rad-reflective hood has fallen over their face. You pull it back, and it is indeed your extraction target. Looking a little pale, unconscious, and drooling, but the face matches your intel.
"I don't want any trouble, maybe your friend's on chems, I don't ask questions. But see, I took care of 'em right? No call to municipal. Now you take your friend and go now. Go, get out!" He tries to shoo you toward the door as you lift the slack body.

[Line 7011] [Options Given: extr_continue2:Leave]

[Line 7012] [Options Given: extr_continue3a:"Wait, how did you recognize me?"]

[Line 7013] [Options Given: extr_continue3b:"How'd my 'friend' get here?"]

[Line 7014] [Option Selected: "Wait, how did you recognize me?"]
$extr_barOwner rolls his eyes, "Your other friend showed me your holo, said look, my other friend the space captain is coming to pick this one up."
"Now you get going, I don't want people thinking my drinks are bad or maybe $extr_barOwner runs a place with no class. Go, go!"

[Line 7015] [Option Selected: "How'd my 'friend' get here?"]
$extr_barOwner sighs loudly, "I tell you, then you go right? Now here's what I tell you: I didn't see anything. I'm running a spacer bar, not a children's creche. People come in, people go out. I don't look too close, I don't ask important questions, it's 'good run?', or 'price of fuel ain't what it was eh?'. That's the business."
"We made a deal, now you're leaving. Out, out!"

[Line 7016] [Option Selected: Leave]
Outside the bar you pass the unconscious form to one of your bodyguards, whose subtle augments make carrying the limp form a matter of casual ease.
The automedic on the shuttle back reports that the agent was heavily and expertly sedated.
Returned to consciousness in secure quarters on your flagship, the agent is suspicious and uncooperative until you give the confirmation phrase you were provided. Calmer now, they have no explanation for how they ended up in $extr_barName.
Maybe it doesn't matter; you just have to get them back, get your pay, and the job is done.

[Line 7018] "Impressive work, captain," the $faction $post says. "I'm told that you've helped us perform quite a coup on the intel front. The analysts are terribly excited."

[Line 7019] "You've done some good work, captain," the $faction $rank says. "Our agent... will recover."
$HeOrShe leans back, eyes focusing on something abstract. "The pirates on the other hand, with the intel we've gained on their organization, their movements, their patsies in the civil service - we shall bring them the swift justice they've earned."

[Line 7019] [Options Given: contact_pickAnotherGreeting:Continue]

[Line 7020] "Good work captain," the $faction $rank says, "I must admit that I was not fully convinced that our agent could be safely extracted. The Pathers... it's never a proper stand-up battle with them." $HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head.
"Intel tells me our agent will provide information that shall let us roll up a great number of Pather infiltrator rings. No details of course, you know how this business is. I need not tell you how many lives you've saved."

custom military bounty

[Line 7023] "Some new targets have come up on the docket," $heOrShe says with a sigh. "If you took a contract to handle one of these bounties, it might just get the brass off my case."

[Line 7024] [Options Given: mcb_start:Ask about what's available on the bounty docket]

[Line 7025] A military officer is holding court at one of the nicer tables; you watch a merc captain approach for a perfunctory exchange of words and mutual tap of datapads. They appear to be acting as some kind of system patrol liaison contracting out bounties.

[Line 7026] [Options Given: mcb_startBar:Talk to the $mcb_manOrWoman from the military offering bounties]

[Line 7027] [Option Selected: Ask about what's available on the bounty docket]
"We've got a few options here," $post $personLastName says, pulling up a shared display with a table of intel reports.
"We've got an op timeslot coming up for an HK squadron that'll handle whatever you don't, so it's really your pick of the bunch. What sort of job do you think you can handle?"

[Line 7028] [Option Selected: Talk to the $mcb_manOrWoman from the military offering bounties]
You approach and the $rank $personLastName gives you a perfunctory nod. "Captain," $heOrShe says, all business.
"I have several assignments on the docket," $heOrShe looks down, scrolling $hisOrHer datapad. A coffee, black, certainly no sugar, is cooling on the table beside $hisOrHer hand. "What sort of job can you handle?"

[Line 7039] $HeOrShe taps on one of the entries to enlarge the report. A face scowls at you from an arrest record holo.
"This one's a pirate hiding out in the $bcb_systemName, that's $bcb_dist light-years away. Had a falling out with an associate who talked. That gave us enough to confirm the intel."
"The reward is $bcb_reward credits and you'd have $bcb_days days to carry out the job. How about it?"

[Line 7040] $HeOrShe taps on one of the entries to enlarge the report. A face scowls at you from an arrest record holo.
"This charming individual believes they're some kind of pirate." $PersonName gets a carnivorous look in $hisOrHer eyes, "$bcb_TargetHeOrShe stole from me. This is unacceptable." $HeOrShe leans back, casually, "The lost credits are irrelevant, of course. What's important is the message such brigandage sends. We can't simply have pirates stealing the hard-earned wealth from those who rightfully possess it."
"The target is hiding in the $bcb_systemName which is $bcb_dist light-years distant. I shall reward you with $bcb_reward credits once you have put down the menace and I shall give you $bcb_days days to do so. Are we agreed?"

[Line 7041] "Ah, this one is a piece of work," $heOrShe brings up a case file. "Luddic Path operative. Connected to a few bombings, piracy, the usual. $bcb_TargetHeOrShe is hiding out in the $bcb_systemName, that's a $bcb_dist light-year hop."
"A few of the local syndics pitched in, so the job's reward is $bcb_reward credits. You'd have $bcb_days days to take $bcb_targetHimOrHer out. Interested?"

[Line 7042] "Ah, this one, yes," $heOrShe pulls up an intel file. "An adherent of the so-called 'Luddic Path'. Believes we'd all be better off smashing our computers and living in caves or some nonsense. You wouldn't believe the damage they cause when they can bring themselves to apply technology to meet their goals. This one is hiding out in the $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years away, and has caused great personal offense."
"I shall provide a reward of $bcb_reward credits for taking care of this fanatic. You'd have $bcb_days days to complete the mission."

[Line 7043] "This one is a sensitive matter," $heOrShe goes quiet for a moment. 
"One of our... former knights has broken their vows to join a sect of the so-called Luddic Path. A heretic recently confessed, confirming our intel on the betrayer. They're hiding out in the $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years from here."
"The Church has granted an indulgence for this execution in consideration of the heinous crimes and heretical acts committed in the name of the prophet. A recompense of $bcb_reward credits is offered as well. It would be expected that the job be complete within $bcb_days days. Do you accept?"

[Line 7044] "I'd take this one on myself if I had a warfleet to command," $heOrShe makes an expression like $heOrShe bit into something sour, "$bcb_targetName is a betrayer, a deserter from $thePersonFaction. An example has to be made. We know $bcb_targetHeOrShe is hiding out in the $bcb_systemName, which is $bcb_dist light-years from here."
"There's a reward of $bcb_reward credits and it'd need to be done within $bcb_days days. Are you up for it?"

[Line 7045] "This one I admit I would relish to take on myself if I was back in my fleet command days. A deserter, a mutineer," $heOrShe sneers, "Call it what you like, a turncoat from $thePersonFaction is hiding out in the $bcb_systemName, just $bcb_dist light-years away."
"There's a reward of $bcb_reward credits and it'd need to be done within $bcb_days days. Are you up for putting down a traitor?"

[Line 7046] "This task troubles my soul." $Rank $personName looks more angry than troubled. $HeOrShe takes a deep breath. "I must pray for forgiveness; wrath is unbecoming to spiritual health."
"Let me proceed. We have been betrayed; a turncoat from $thePersonFaction has stolen ships and spread mutiny. We have good intel that $bcb_targetHeOrShe is hiding in the $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years from here, awaiting some kind of rendezvous."
"They must be intercepted within $bcb_days days. Your payment would be $bcb_reward credits and my personal thanks. Will you perform this service?"

[Line 7047] "This one," $heOrShe focuses the briefing, "Is not for the faint of heart. An elite mercenary... well, you don't need to know the details. Let's just say $bcb_targetHeOrShe made the wrong people very, very unhappy. $bcb_TargetHeOrShe is hiding out in the $bcb_systemName - that's $bcb_dist light-years away."
"The reward is $bcb_reward credits - lots of hazard pay - and with good reason. Don't take $bcb_targetHimOrHer lightly. Time to complete is $bcb_days days." 
$HeOrShe looks at you with grim resolution. "Just so you know, you'd not be the first to try this job. Never heard back from the other guy. There's no shame if you want to stay away from this one."

[Line 7048] "This one requires some discretion." You note the glow of REDACTED blocks peppered across the briefing as $personName scrolls through details. "A fleet of Domain-era derelict drone warships was spotted in the $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years from here."
"They're usually dormant, guarding some probe that fell off the records. Catches surveyors by surprise. This is different." $HeOrShe looks grim. "A fleet of these things wandering off on their own is, frankly, terrifying. They're not supposed to have independent hyperspace capability or much in the way of fuel capacity, for that matter."
"Whatever this swarm is up to, it needs to be stopped. The reward is $bcb_reward credits - higher than normal, both for the hazard and for your discretion." $Post $personLastName smiles with black humor, "Wouldn't want to alarm the citizens, ha-ha."
"You'll take it, right? We need to conclude the matter within $bcb_days days."

[Line 7049] "This one requires some discretion." You note the glow of REDACTED blocks peppered across the briefing as $personName scrolls through details. "A fleet of Remnant drone warships was spotted in the $bcb_systemName, only $bcb_dist light-years from here."
"These things are left over from one of the AI Wars - some pencilneck decided they weren't worth the cost of cleaning up. But this fleet is more active than usual so there's been some concern from up the chain of command." $HeOrShe skewers you with a look, "Way up."
"Whatever they're up to, some important people will sleep better if it's stopped. The reward is $bcb_reward credits - higher than normal, both for the hazard and for your discretion. Command wants this done within $bcb_days days."

[Line 7050] "I speak in strict confidence," $heOrShe looks sternly at you. "A long range patrol spotted a fleet of Remnant drone warships in the $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years distant. That patrol didn't make it back."
"We did find an intel drop left by that patrol, and in it we found this." $Rank $personLastName pulls up a grainy image, little more than a silhouette in false color. An angular shape. "It's unlike anything we've got on the AI War leftovers. Analysis shows no similarities in component profiles, so it's not even some kind of hack-job." With a swipe the $rank dismisses the image. 
"Take it out. The reward is $bcb_reward credits. If that seems high, it's because you'd be dealing with something unusual. Unusual means risky, and STRATCOM thinks an unusual problem could use an unusual solution, thus-" $heOrShe indicates you with an open palm. "Are you in?"

[Line 7051] "This one comes straight from the office of the Hegemon," $heOrShe watches you carefully. "A long range patrol picked up a probe-drop in the $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years distant. This is what it found."
$Rank $personLastName pulls up a shared display, swiping through REDACTED warnings and biometric confirmations. You see the grainy image of a large orbital structure, subsections highlighted in false color and labeled by some Hegemony analyst.  "A functional Remnant station - I believe 'nexus' is what Tri-Tach called them - leftover from the AI Wars. Some pencilneck thought these were too expensive to clear out. Ticking time-bombs if you ask me. You never know when it might start pumping out warships or PKs." With a swipe the $rank dismisses the image.
"The Hegemon finally decided to do something about it - unofficially. That means an operator like you," $heOrShe says in a way that suggests the navy should be taking care of this. "The reward is $bcb_reward credits for hazard and discretion. You'll have $bcb_days days to take this thing out."

[Line 7052] "I speak now of a matter most disturbing," $heOrShe says, making the sign of Ludd's hammer. "We have received word from a far-travelling prospector of the faith that there is a functional Remnant station - I believe the technical term is 'nexus' - $bcb_dist light-years away, in the $bcb_systemName. A long range scout sent by the Knights has confirmed this."
"This 'nexus' dates to one or the other of the AI Crusades. The Hegemony considered them 'too expensive'  to properly cleanse." $HeOrShe looks up and seems to quote something, "'Thus does evil prevail when good falters not for want of courage, but mere empty stomach or weary limb." $Rank $personName turns $hisOrHer eyes back to you, filled with some new fervor. "It has been left to the Church to take action."
        
"We have not the fleets the Hegemony does and it would be... impolitic to flaunt the moral failure of our wavering ally in the battle against these artificial demons. So the Church comes to you with an offer of $bcb_reward credits, with due consideration of the risk and your discretion. We would expect this task to be done within $bcb_days days."

[Line 7053] "One of our undercover walkers has found records long hidden by the Hegemony. They have hidden the existence of a fully functional Remnant station, or 'nexus' as the Tri-Tachyon apostates call it, some $bcb_dist light-years away, in the $bcb_systemName."
"It is truly an obscenity in the eyes of Providence that such a citadel of corruption would be left standing all these cycles since the great AI Crusades. We can only speculate why the Hegemony has hidden them, but," $rank $personName speaks with greater fervor, "Truly it is our righteous Path to purge these machine-demons from God's holy vacuum."  
        
"If only I could lead a fleet to do this task - alas, the Path's warships are stretched thin, and to amass a fleet able to take such a target would invite... attention. So, we set aside our pride and offer you $bcb_reward credits to do this holy duty - within $bcb_days days, for always evil labors while the good rest idle. Will you do it?"

[Line 7054] "We need an enemy station taken out," $heOrShe taps $hisOrHer datapad a couple times with a finger, watching you, just letting that sink in. "It's a big job," $heOrShe says steadily, "With a reward to match. $bcb_reward credits."
$Rank $personName pulls up a display showing $bcb_fleetName, in the $bcb_systemName. "That's $bcb_dist light-years away and we expect the operation to be done within $bcb_days days so that our... other arrangements may proceed. You don't have to worry about them, just focus on the job and you'll be paid. Think you can handle it?"

[Line 7058] [Options Given: ucb_start:Ask about taking on one of the bounty jobs]

[Line 7059] A $ucb_manOrWoman occupies a booth on the back wall, a pair of goons hidden in shadow but for the glow of their augmented eyes. You watch an obvious merc-slash-pirate approach for an exchange of words and tap of datapads. Farming out underworld hits?

[Line 7060] [Options Given: ucb_startBar:Approach the $ucb_manOrWoman contracting out underworld bounties]

[Line 7061] [Option Selected: Ask about taking on one of the bounty jobs]
"Would you like to get your hands dirty?" $HeOrShe bares $hisOrHer teeth in an expression that's too bloodthirsty to be called a smile. "I've got a few jobs here that might fit your talents."

[Line 7062] [Option Selected: Approach the $ucb_manOrWoman contracting out underworld bounties]
As you approach, $heOrShe inspects you with professional detachment, subtle cybernetics flickering on the edge of IR. "An operator, are you? Like getting your hands dirty?" 
$HeOrShe doesn't smile. The expression is closer to a predator baring its teeth.
"I might be able to arrange a job which matches your... talents," $heOrShe says, implants flickering in $hisOrHer eyes.

[Line 7073] "This job is for a trade fleet. The owner needs to receive a stern message." 
$HeOrShe pulls up what looks like an internal customs inspection order, with attached fleet disposition report. "We've put in a word to a, ah, friendly officer in the customs department to hold them up for inspection in the $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years away." $HeOrShe smirks, "Very convenient, that. Less convenient is the patrol on guard to ensure they don't leave too soon, so I'll leave it to you to figure out how to get around that little complication."
"You'll get $bcb_reward credits for taking them out. The time frame is tight - you've got at most $bcb_days days before they get around to the inspection, and then they'll get away. How's that sound?"

[Line 7074] "Just look at this do-gooder." $HeOrShe pulls up a standard ID holo of a military officer in uniform. "Too upright and honest to know when it's time to compromise a bit to make things easier on everyone. Get paid, look the other way, doesn't hurt anyone who doesn't deserve it, right?" $personName shakes $hisOrHer head at stubborn law-abiders.
"$bcb_TargetHeOrShe's commanding a $bcb_patrolFaction patrol fleet operating out of $bcb_targetMarketName in the $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years away. You'll find $bcb_targetHimOrHer patrolling either near there, a nearby jump-point, or one of their orbital strategic assets like a comm relay and the like."
$HeOrShe dismisses the ID holo with a contemptuous flick. "Take $bcb_targetHimOrHer out. You'll get $bcb_reward credits. I'll give you $bcb_days days to complete the job. Think you can handle that?"

[Line 7075] $HeOrShe pulls up a blurry holo taken on a docking concourse. "This particular mercenary has been causing a lot of problems for an operation a friend of mine is running. I'd like to see you solve my friend's problems... for good."
$PersonName swipes the holo away and pulls up a sector map, "We've set $bcb_targetHimOrHer up on a wild goose chase in the $bcb_systemName, only $bcb_dist light-years away. $bcb_TargetHeOrShe thinks $bcb_targetHeOrShe is tracking down a dead-drop of advanced weapons," $heOrShe smiles ruthlessly.
"I'm arranging this as a favor for my friend, and my friend has agreed to pay whoever takes the job $bcb_reward credits. Time to complete is $bcb_days days. Can you take care of it?"

LOCRM - Miners variant
------------------------------
[Line 7080] Amid the low-priority updates you receive upon entering the colonial datasphere, a minor report is flagged for your attention.

[Line 7080] [Options Given: locrm_removeBecauseColony2:View the report]

[Line 7081] [Option Selected: View the report]
A small crew of miners, abandoned by their exploration company, was been rescued from the surface of $name.
Left without pay, they've sold the remains of their survey and survival equipment for basic necessities, and now haunt the landing facilities to seek work in local industry, or as crew on newly arriving ships.
Colonial MuniSec is monitoring the situation.

[Line 7082] Upon entering orbit, your comms officer reports "$PlayerSirOrMadam, we're getting a signal. Point of origin from structure on the surface."
Sensors takes over the report, "Scan shows a small power source, several light planetary craft, and robotic drill rigs. Temporary structures. Mining survey?"

[Line 7083] Your comms officer reports that the signal from the surface is still active. Sensors indicate that the mining survey site is largely intact, a cluster of temporary structures with a significant power source, light planetary craft, and robotic drill rigs.

[Line 7084] [Options Given: locrm_contact0:Hail the signal coming from the surface]

[Line 7085] [Option Selected: Hail the signal coming from the surface]
After a couple of false starts, the comms protocols settle down to establish a fitful connection.

[Line 7086] "Calling $shipOrFleet in orbit- a connection! Glorious stars!" Relief washes over the $manOrWoman's face.
"Signal clear. Are you the commander of the $shipOrFleet in orbit? We're miners, or we were. There was an accident, our main rig blew. Then the company pulled out, they left us here to die!"
$HeOrShe grimaces in anger and frustration, "The bloodsuckers said a return trip 'wasn't in the contract' if we couldn't produce. Will you help us return to the core?"

[Line 7086] [Options Given: locrm_contact2:Continue]

[Line 7087] [Option Selected: Continue]
After a moment of hesitation, $personName quickly adds "We've got skilled techs, and operators. Lots of spacefaring experience. We'd be happy to crew for the passage home."
$HeOrShe uploads a workcrew manifest displaying relevant skills. It would require 136 crew berths to transport the miners.

The miners' leader uploads a passenger manifest displaying relevant skill-sets. It will require 136 crew berths to transport these miners.

A small crew of stranded pirates was rescued from emergency shelters near a wrecked spacecraft in a remote province on the surface of $name.

"The rad-blasted betrayer Fenius left us here! Told us he knew where Old Marlowe buried a stash. Stash o' lies, more like," $heOrShe spits voluminously, and hatefully.
"Took all the ships and what little loot... er, cargo, that is. Legitimate salvage and digging equipment! That's us, legitimate salvors done in by a bad lot and left here to die in the dirt. Like, like Luddie worms!"
The $manOrWoman looks pained, "It's no way for a spacer to die, down here. Take us up, captain. We'll be good to ya."

[Line 7158] [Option Selected: "So who's this Fenius?"]
"Ah, Ormon Fenius. Fenius the Outcast, he's called. The slimiest piece of trash that ever oozed from the mud of..."
$HeOrShe pauses, thoughtfully. "Come to think of it, I dunno where he's from. Somewhere awful where everyone lies, cheats, and steals from one another, probably."
At this, $heOrShe looks around, "'Course there's properly done lying, cheating, and stealing. Quite acceptable, using one's own wits to win a prize through clever work," $heOrShe thumps $hisOrHer chest, "That's my trade, it is! Cleverness and craft. Not like Fenius."

"Fenius, why he'll lie, cheat, and steal for anything, from anyone. The man has no honor! And, and," the pirate is getting worked up, standing to shout, "He's no fun!"
No fun. The worst of crimes.
The pirate sits, calming down. "He let us land so we could get Marlowe's stash, then blasted our ships from orbit and took off. One reactor went critical, the other... well, just failed. But the previous, ah, owner of my ship thought to have survival equipment. So here we are."

[Line 7160] [Option Selected: "So who's this Marlowe?"]
"Ah, Old Marlowe!" The pirate gets almost misty eyed, "Now there was a pirate. He could drink! Oh, how he drank. And fight! Bloodthirsty, he was, would shoot you in the front, back, side - any direction he could get. Whatever it took to win."
"Well, he weren't exactly a nice man. And when he gambled, he cheated. Oh, how he cheated! A sight to see, I tell you. Anyway, eventually he cheated the wrong mark and," $heOrShe makes a gun-shape with $hisOrHer hand and motions firing it, making a wet noise. $HeOrShe uses the other hand to indicate a generous volume of splatter from the exit wound, if you're interpreting the body language correctly.

"Marlowe was rich, see. Big rich, real rich. But no one's found his stash. Thought we might 'cause I was stupid enough to trust Fenius, despite his reputation..."

[Line 7163] [Option Selected: "I'll help you... if you help me find Fenius. I want that treasure."]
The pirate looks at you for a long moment.
"Can't promise I can find him, can't promise he really knows where Marlowe's loot is. Fenius is a slippery worm, he is."
"But if you get me and my crew off this rock and into a nice safe pirate port, then I'll help you. I'll help you 'cause I could use some revenging on Fenius," $heOrShe curls $hisOrHer hands into fists and knocks them together.

"'Course you will, captain, 'course you will." The pirate nods obediently. "But I know Fenius, and he ain't spilling the truth unless you make it hurt. Just helping you with my knowledge, I am. I know my place."

[Line 7165] [Option Selected: "How do I know I can trust you?"]
"Can't," $heOrShe shrugs. "But you've got me, an honest pirate, at the bottom of a big ol' gravwell, so I've not got much to negotiate with."

"Aye, surely," the pirate leader backtracks nervously. "I read you green and clear, 'Luddic faithful'."
The $manOrWoman nods enthusiastically, "Can't say I haven't prayed a bit meself from time to time," then over $hisOrHer shoulder "Isn't that right? You saw me prayin' that time." 
The pirate turns back to you, "We all agree, um, my fellow $playerBrotherOrSister. Now, can you take us aboard? We're good spacers, can work our way."

[Line 7168] [Option Selected: "Are you pirates?"]
"No!" $HeOrShe shouts defensively. "No no, never... " $heOrShe appears to be trying to gauge your reaction through the fits of the poor comm link.
"...Yes. Maybe? A little, from time to time, perhaps. Desperate times, these are, aren't they? We think of ourselves more as rogues of the fringe. Corsairs, if you will. Good, honest folk driven to low means to make ends meet. Sounds better when you say it like that, don't it?"

"Well," $heOrShe draws this out, leaning back.
"If you're demanding only the strictest sort of definition, why then I suppose we couldn't rightly object to that choice nomenclature on the, what's it, empirical grounds, now could we."

[Line 7171] [Option Selected: "So you're not pirates."]
"I didn't say we weren't, but..." $heOrShe pauses a moment, in furious thought, before deciding that you're constructing a fiction for $himOrHer to play along with. For whose benefit? Your own crew, perhaps.
"Aye. Aye, that's right. Not pirates, as you will." The pirate nods emphatically, and gives a wink.

[Line 7172] [Option Selected: "Tell me about Old Marlowe's treasure."]
"Treasure? Oh, Old Marlowe's stash?" The pirate snorts dismissively. "Weren't no thing. Not here, anyway." 
"We come out all this way, the rad-addled betrayer claiming all the while he knows where Marlowe left his riches, this very planet. We go down to the spot with our diggers ready and have a look and then, and then!" $HeOrShe claps $hisOrHer hands together with a smack.
"Gunned in the back, we are! Hit from orbit with our shields down." The pirate waves an arm around, "Reactor breach on the one ship, blew half away the other. Real mess, had to scrub bits of my mates off my vac suit, I did."

The pirate barks a laugh, then stops suddenly.
"You serious?" $HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head, "No, no. We're free spirits, you see. In prison, our uh human essence wouldn't have a chance to, uh, flourish."
"Better to be stuck on a rock then stuck IN a rock with a Heggie watching you at all your personal businesses, right? That's what I think."

Their trip back to the core worlds won't be pleasant or comfortable, but they won't take up any valuable crew berths.
Next step: find a figure of sufficient authority to reward you with a collective bounty for this mass arrest.

[Line 7203] [Option Selected: "This one." (prepare a raid)]
You convene your officers to plan a raid to capture the pirates so that they might be brought to justice and, it is safe to assume, result in an appropriate bounty payout.
The pirates are few in number and woefully undersupplied.

[Line 7203] [Options Given: mktRaidNonMarket:Continue]

[Line 7204] Your officers were conservative in planning, crafting an imaginative tactical scenario which assumed the pirates possess all sorts of armaments and preparation which, in the end, they did not: anti-armor capability, a drone recon network, sentry turrets, field fortifications, and finally an EW-proof ghost gun ambush.
In the end, the operation is a simple matter of cutting the lights then punching through flimsy shelter walls to stun-round those few pirates with live firearms detected and flagged by the marines' personal combat radar.
They missed the hand-made bomb, however.

[Line 7205] The pirate leader is justifiably defeated-looking, ashamed at being taken so easily despite the circumstances.
The pirates are removed to the $shipOrFleet brigs, packed closer than even the minimal comforts of the lowest crewmember's berth.

[Line 7206] You call for a halt to the raid and consider your options.
If nothing else, the pirate leader must be sweating in the e-shelter down on the surface. Wondering what you're planning, waiting for the flash and bang of a hostile breach.

There's grumbling from the pirates, but they accept your promise that the next port will be their last stop.

[Line 7211] [Option Selected: Shuttle the marooned pirates to $name]
The pirate crew cheers as they are off-boarded, shouting boasts and singing an off-color song about the variety of substances they plan to abuse. Others, grim-faced, mutter grisly plans to revenge themselves upon Fenius and his crew. 
A handful of pirates wish to remain in your employment, offering to forgo the usual signing bonus due to your generosity. Those who have approval from both your security chief and their section leaders are allowed to remain.

[Line 7212] You've arrived at a suitably lawless starport to offload the formerly marooned pirates you rescued. They are eager to go, as they've found that Luddic discipline is a poor fit for their swashbuckling lifestyle.

[Line 7213] [Option Selected: Shuttle the pirates to $name]

A single member of the pirates, having become quite taken with Luddism, wishes to remain in your employment. They forgo the usual signing bonus due to your charity and, with approval from both your security chief and their section leader, are allowed to remain.

I'll have a subordinate, ah, handle the matter." $HeOrShe winks, suggesting some secretive means that you don't quite follow.
Before you can inquire, $heOrShe has your comms transferred to a security officer bearing a blank face and a dramatic scar.

Your  comms are swiftly transferred to a security officer who makes the arrangements.

[Line 7226] [Options Given: locrp_imprisonPirates2:Continue]

[Line 7227] [Option Selected: Continue]
You assign your own subordinate in turn to coordinate the transfer of the pirates, their spirits much diminished by the time spent in your brig, to the local authorities.
The local bureaucracy alternates between impatient and bored with the entire proceeding.
Nonetheless, you manage to rid yourself of the entire crew in exchange for a modest reward. A not insignificant number of these individuals have criminal records, and a subset of those crimes fall under the jurisdiction of interfactional anti-piracy agreements which include a protocol to automatically pay out standing bounties.

"We believed a new revelation had been given, like that revealed unto Ludd.

[Line 7265] [Option Selected: "What are you doing on the fringe?" (conceal your mission to find them)]
"Oh, I... I see." $HisOrHer contenance shifts between relief and worry. "The Church, they- we are repentant! I swear it, even before you arrived."

[Line 7292] You explain that you are commissioned by the Church of Galactic Redemption, and although the powers you are granted are worldly in nature, perhaps - provided the former heretics act in good faith - you could ensure a righteous outcome.

[Line 7316] [Option Selected: Shuttle the rescued Luddics to $name]
As promised, you allow the lost heretics to disembark. Their shuttles are met by a serene curate backed by a pair of frowning Knights of Ludd. The curate welcomes the refugees as they bow, hands clasped, or fall to their knees in repentance.
Though the Church now shows a face of reconciliation, the Knight-Inquisitors will surely come later for a full accounting of their sin.

[Line 7318] You've arrived at a colony controlled by the Luddic Path suitable for offloading the heretics you rescued from the fringe.

[Line 7318] [Options Given: locrl_offloadHereticsToPath0:Shuttle the rescued heretics to $name
locrl_offloadNotYet:Not yet]

[Line 7319] [Option Selected: Shuttle the rescued heretics to $name]
The somewhat unconventional body that passes for the port authority has some pointed questions as you arrange for the offloading of nearly two hundred heretics from the fringe.
You iterate rapidly up the chain of authority and find yourself speaking to the equivalent of the top civilian administrator.

[Line 7320] [Options Given: locrl_hereticsToPath:Inquire about offloading a community of Luddic heretics]

[Line 7321] [Option Selected: Inquire about offloading a community of Luddic heretics]
"Heretics?" $Post $personLastName sits up as you explain, intent upon the challenge of bringing more of the Faithful to the true Path of Ludd.
"They have been so very lost," $heOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head as $heOrShe speaks, "First by the corruption and weakness of the Church, then by the demonic rantings of a madman."
"You have done the right thing, $playerBrotherOrSister, to bring them to us. Their first few steps on the Path will be painful, but we shall be at their side to guide them and provide spiritual strength."

[Line 7321] [Options Given: locrl_hereticsToPath2harsh:"I'll have them loaded on shuttles immediately."
locrl_hereticsToPather2mercy:"Show mercy, $brotherOrSister. They were good-intentioned but misled."]

[Line 7322] [Option Selected: "I'll have them loaded on shuttles immediately."]
The Pather nods. "This step is best done quickly."

[Line 7323] [Option Selected: "Show mercy, $brotherOrSister. They were good-intentioned but misled."]
The Pather doesn't quite sigh. "Let the compassion you feel now fuel your dedication to an ultimate Good, greater than the small pains they - and we - must carry."
$HisOrHer voice fills with conviction. "In the end, Ludd's promise awaits us all."

[Line 7324] Option(s) Selected: ['locrl_hereticsToPath2harsh'];['locrl_hereticsToPather2mercy']
The matter resolves to a simple business of logistics.
Some of your subordinates are awkward in dealing with Pathers but soon discover that when it comes to practical need the Path knows there are times to set high-minded spiritual demands aside in the interest of expedience.

"Heretics you say?" The Knight sits up even more rigidly, somehow, to meet this challenge to $hisOrHer militant faith. "Yes, they are a problem which falls under our purview."
"I shall have a novice collect a full witnessing on the situation from your subordinates so that the inquisitors may make a full, and just, accounting of their heresy." $HeOrShe raises an eyebrow, "Presuming your cooperation, of course. For which you would have the thanks of both myself and of the Knights of Ludd."

[Line 7328] [Options Given: locrl_hereticsToKnights2harsh:"I'll have them loaded on shuttles immediately."
locrl_hereticsToKnights2mercy:"Show mercy, Knight. They are good-intentioned but misled."]

[Line 7329] [Option Selected: "I'll have them loaded on shuttles immediately."]
The Knight gives a stiff, small bow. "Providence guide us."

[Line 7330] [Option Selected: "Show mercy, Knight. They are good-intentioned but misled."]
The Knight doesn't quite sigh, and says, "You've familiar with the Road to Hell, $playerSirOrMadam?"
"Ancient aphorisms aside, I promise to you that we shall provide justice and Ludd's teaching shall provide mercy. Anything less would breach the oath I've sworn."

[Line 7331] Option(s) Selected: ['locrl_hereticsToKnights2harsh'];['locrl_hereticsToKnights2mercy']
The matter resolves to a simple business of logistics, which both your subordinates and the Knights' gang of shockingly young and clean-cut novices handle with aplomb.

"Blessed day. Captain, I presume?" $lpt_heOrShe says. "I wish to arrange transport for myself and my party to the shrine of $lpt_entityName in the $lpt_systemName. I can, of course, provide payment. Would $lpt_reward credits be worth a journey of $lpt_dist lightyears?"

[Line 7400] [Option Selected: Try to calm the well-dressed $manOrWoman bothering the bartender]
You manage to insert yourself into the $manOrWoman's field of attention with a friendly greeting. The bartender gives you a thankful nod behind $hisOrHer back.
"These people, these space-pilots, are so addled by rocket fuel and zero-g that they simply cannot comprehend respectful! Customer! Service!"
Each of these three words is accompanied by an open handed slap on the bar. You watch as a small splash leaps over the rim of an otherwise untouched drink at each impact.

[Line 7400] [Options Given: avipt_textBar2:Perform an act of leadership
avipt_textBarDecline:Disengage while you still can]

[Line 7401] [Option Selected: Perform an act of leadership]
You put on a look of stern and stoic authority, that look your bridge officers whisper about as your 'captain face' when they think you can't hear them.
This seems to do the trick.
This individual - wealthy, important, and well-connected, by their own description - paid $avipt_reward credits upfront for priority transport within $avipt_timelimit days to $avipt_marketName, but the ship left port early last night without a word for reasons you cannot fathom. This is 'a shocking disgrace' which 'besmirches the already dubious name of all space-captainry'.
You nod, your expression suitably grim at hearing of such terrible treatment.

[Line 7401] [Options Given: avipt_textBarAccept:Offer to transport the VIP for the same fee
avipt_textBarDecline:Try to withdraw from the conversation
avipt_textBarDeclineRude:Explain to the VIP that they probably deserved this]

[Line 7402] [Option Selected: Offer to transport the VIP for the same fee]
Your offer manages to stop the $manOrWoman from talking at you for several seconds as $heOrShe considers your demeanor and your offer. 
"I accept," $heOrShe says with the enunciation of royalty, "Though I shall only be paying after we arrive at $avipt_marketName. And I shall require some of your crew to handle my luggage. I need not remind you that these are my valuable personal goods, not crates of... of common space-bolts to be tossed about by half-drunken dockworkers."
As you confirm final details over a free round from the bartender, you consider which of your junior officers to assign to babysitting duty...

[Line 7403] [Option Selected: Try to withdraw from the conversation]
You stand as if at attention, give the alleged VIP a formal farewell, and march to the other end of the bar without a backward glance. 
$HeOrShe is too confused by your formality to express outrage until it is too late and you are well out of range.
From the corner of your eye, you can see the well-dressed $manOrWoman slowly start working $himOrHerself into another, slightly different rage.

[Line 7403] [Options Given: contact_declineBarNoContinue:Avert your eyes before you are forced to re-engage]

[Line 7404] [Option Selected: Explain to the VIP that they probably deserved this]
The VIP stares at you, appalled at your manners. Behind, the bartender is doing an admirable job suppressing a grin. 
The well-dressed $manOrWoman, confronted directly, seems to be at a complete loss. $HisOrHer mouth opens, then closes, opens again - and then $heOrShe storms out of the bar. 
There's a pause as your ears adjust to the relatively muted din of the establishment before cheers and hurrahs erupt from the other patrons.

You meet the VIP on the way out the airlock to a waiting private shuttle. It seems the politick thing to do, especially because the promised payment just cleared.
"The commander here," $heOrShe indicates the officer you assigned to the VIP (an officer-trainee, in fact, who drew the short straw and was given a fancy uniform), "Performed acceptably, such that I might endorse a commendation."
With that, $heOrShe says merely, "Captain," then turns on $hisOrHer heel and exits the ship, the small fleet of $hisOrHer luggage wheeling itself behind obediently. The airlock seals mercifully shut.

You prove yourself worthy of association by partaking in a round of 'Atmo Drops', a drink centered around consuming eye-watering liquor as quickly as possible.
The mercs are drunk, for sure, but composed enough to speak around the details of why they're being investigated by local authorities.
After a couple of the mercs head up to order a round of 'Orbital Bombardments' their leader pulls you aside and sketches out a proposal. "We've got $motr_numberOfMarines suits, experienced operators. We can fight in vac or atmo, one to five gee." He smirks at the look you give, "Okay, three. Four if it's quick and there's a bonus." A scarred hand dismisses this, "Details!"
"What matters is I'll offer our contract for $motr_priceText credits. Practically charity, isn't it? Put us to work, or sell it off elsewhere, doesn't matter to me if you can get us outta this fix. What'dya say?"

Some clever device provided by the mercs convinces the port authority automated scanners that two particular cargo containers are half-filled with mildly radioactive silicate gravel and nothing else.
Your logistics officer sneaks them aboard your $shipOrFleet without inconvenience.

You prove yourself worthy of association by partaking in a round of 'Atmo Drops', a drink centered around consuming eye-watering liquor as quickly as possible.
The mercs are drunk, for sure, but maintain their composure enough to speak around the details of why they're being investigated by local authorities - your local authorities.
After a couple of the mercs head up to order a round of 'Orbital Bombardments' their leader pulls you aside and sketches out a proposal. "We've got $motr_numberOfMarines suits, experienced operators. Be a shame if we couldn't see action, instead got locked up."
"I'll offer our contract for $motr_priceText credits. Practically charity, isn't it? Put us to work, or sell it off elsewhere, doesn't matter to me. After all," $heOrShe winks, "You're the boss around here, yeah? You can get us out of this fix."

$HisOrHer hand picks up an empty glass, as if to drink, pauses, then sets it back down.

[Line 7451] A nearby hostile fleet is tracking your movements, making a ground operation impossible.

[Line 7454] Your sensors officer reports that a high-powered scan of the coordinates provided shows the $rdsm_megacorpName $rdsm_target is long abandoned, but appears relatively intact.
However, there is also a fresh burnt-out shuttle in a nearby landing complex. On the obvious approach path is the scar of a debris field, apparently created by the low-velocity impact of a second shuttle. Nearby ruins show signs of some light orbital bombardment, likely retaliatory.
It appears as though a lightly-equipped scavenger attempted this operation once before and was caught off guard by the local decivs. Your sensors officer coordinates targeted scans with Tactical to estimate hostile combat capabilities.

[Line 7458] [Option Selected: Drop 10 units of supplies at a nearby location to distract the locals]
You order a few cargo crates loaded with supplies then rigged with visual-audio-radio emergency beacons and disposable landing rockets.
It's an old trick when dealing with decivs, but it usually works. Whether they accept the supplies as payment, bribery, or simply relatively high tech goods in an environment largely cut off from interstellar commerce, the value of these crates is literally astronomical.
You watch a cluster of crates shrink to spots, then disappear into the face of $name.

"Drop telemetry reads successful surface contact," your sensors officer reports, who taps at their console then mumbles something into another comms channel. "Confirmed by $shipOrFleet instruments."
Tactical signals acknowledgement, then says "Mission is go." 
The landing shuttles glitter with a burst of propulsion then drop in silent formation toward the surface. The cargo drop was close enough to the target zone to distract any decivs present, but far enough - hopefully - to clear or persuade away any active resistance.
Within minutes, shuttles report unimpeded landing. Salvor crews deploy immediately through the settling dust cloud, only lightly armed to ensure maximum operational speed.

The small salvage team accesses the $rdsm_megacorpName $rdsm_target, cutting through sealed locks and blasting weak points as needed. Their work is sloppy, even crude, compared to your ops chief's usual standards - intentionally so. The physical evidence of your crews' intrusion is meant to appear to be the work of local decivs' random plundering rather than a targeted job.
Objective found, your salvors swap out the specified data core and install the fake. They carefully create the appearance of random tampering, plundering a few obvious modular and interface components that would be of interest to cut-off decivs, then re-dust the scene.
From orbit, your sensors officer spots movement in nearby terrain; armed locals. The salvors perform a quick evac before they can bring heavy weapons to bear and, aside from a few light energy weapon burns on the shuttle plating, there's no harm done.

"You've earned a degree of my trust," $heOrShe says. "I would ask you to help me send a," $heOrShe chuckles, "very important message."
"One of my rivals has established a staging point, a secret outpost, on the planet $rsom_planetName in the $rsom_systemName, which is $rsom_dist light-years away. They've stashed a lot of $rsom_product there, awaiting transport. I'm not sure where they got it all, maybe an old cache, or it's a transit point from some other supplier. What I do know," $heOrShe growls, "is that they're severely undercutting the prices we've all worked so hard to keep at sustainable levels."
"Raid the outpost. Plunder the $rsom_product. Sell the loot at whatever black market you like - at market rate. It will be your payment."

RSOM planet interactions

[Line 7479] The planet below appears to lack any settlements or open comms transmissions. You have your comms officer do a broad transmission of the IFF codes, and a simple ping of approval is returned.
The source of the ping is an outcrop overlooking a plausibly natural-looking plateau. You couldn't ask for a more perfect site to land a shuttle, nor one more exposed to weapon emplacements which would be concealed in the surrounding bluffs.

[Line 7481] A nearby hostile fleet is tracking your movements, making a ground operation impossible.

[Line 7482] A flight of shuttles is deployed, armed lightly enough to show respect to the smugglers but without being outwardly conspicuous. What appears to be a motley logistics crew with token guards approach the armored doors of the hidden base, hauling their basic cargo-moving tools: robotic lifts and agrav-fitted pallets, the usual.
Upon entrance, at the signal, weapons-fire erupts from the entire party. False air tanks conceal light arms and single-shot anti-armor tubes; utility panniers are stuffed with grenades and miniature assault drones. All are loosed in a few seconds of blinding violence which catch the smugglers completely off-guard.
After the initial shock comes the grind, and your marines pay for lack of heavy armor as they face recessed auto-turrets and not more than a few heavily armed criminals hiding in the worm-tunnels which loop through and around the rotten stone.

[Line 7483] It was the bloody job your contact $rsom_contactName had in mind. Such a shocking display of incompetence is sure to cause a shake-up in whichever criminal enterprise this lot is - was, rather - involved with.
And now you've got a hold full of hot $rsom_product to unload.

[Line 7484] [Option Selected: Talk your way in, and out, of the secret outpost]
To ensure everything goes smoothly, you take personal command of the lead transport shuttle.
There's a mere flicker of targeting lasers and a sweep or two of radar. Nothing to worry about, you calmly assure your pilot, who looks to be breaking out in sweat.
Your landing is met by little more than a large, armored cargo-hatch opening from under an overhang; an invitation.

Your party is armed and armored, but respectfully - these are underworld criminals who wish to be considered dangerous - but not indecently. Over-icing the cake, as it were, would appear suspicious; there's a delicate balance to navigate when it comes to these things, you explain to your nervous crew. You take care not to mention the recessed autoturrets that have been tracking your shuttle.
Confidence is the word.

The local boss left in charge of this depressing cave has the pale, antsy look of an underling who has been cooped up for too long with little to do but gamble and use.
He wipes a greasy lock of hair from his forehead and looks at you suspiciously. His stinking underlings finger their short, brutish guns.

"Diego can eat rads and burn in vacuum, for all I care. Think's he's too fancy to come out here and do a bit of grunt work? Just like Diego."
He jabs a finger at you, "You can tell him I said that, too. I don't even care."

"It is, isn't it," the man says slowly.
He looks at you with a new sense of self-confidence.
"You're not afraid to get your hands dirty, are you cap," he says with a gleam in his eye. Or maybe it's a pre-hangover glaze, judging from his shaky posture. "I had a good feeling about you as soon as I saw you weren't Diego."

[Line 7489] [Options Given: rsom_avoidCombatOutSober:"Me, uh, too. Now then! There's work to do..."]

[Line 7490] [Option Selected: "I'm afraid Diego had a little accident. Boss is getting me to fill in." (lie)]
"An accident? How? Where?" The man's hands tense. "Diego never has accidents. He's careful."
A thought congeals, slowly but surely.
"Well. I suppose he's not that careful. But he's lucky, always lucky. What happened?"

[Line 7491] [Option Selected: "Ever seen a cheap agrav plate overload? Should fail-safe. Unless..."]
"Unless..." the man looks at you, strung along on your words. He takes a few moments to pick up on your implication.
To help him understand, you give a concerned look and dart your eyes around. Then, in low words, you explain that perhaps it should be discussed later. 'Accidents' like that don't just happen without someone wanting them to happen, and who knows if there aren't more snakes in the organization? Someone must be making a move - but we can't let them know that we know, much less let them know we know they know we know.
The boss nods along, now looking at even his own crew suspiciously.

[Line 7492] [Option Selected: "Let's get the cargo loading. I'll fill you in."]
He takes you to a grubby office, a utility nook really, overlooking the main bay as your crews get to work loading the $rsom_product.
A bottle of something strong and cheap appears, and you do your part in pretending to drink it as you fill his head with paranoid half-truths built on details he reveals.

"A disagreement?" The man looks more than shocked; appalled. "But Diego's his own brother, his blood. He'd never cut Diego out of a job. Never! Never ever."
He looks unsteady, physically unwell, as if what was solid hullplate turned out to be little more than ration-wrappings.
"What could be so terrible? Diego, Diego..." He shakes his head, almost in tears.

[Line 7494] [Option Selected: "It's bad. Couldn't tell it... not without a drink."]
"Of course, of course," the boss says, putting a hand on your shoulder. Now that you can smell the metabolic byproducts - and spillage - of hard, bad liquor, you would suppose that he has a hangover to drink away.
"I've right forgot my welcome, haven't I. Come, come! I've got a bottle open. It's good stuff. Put your crew to work loading and we can talk about what happened. Stars above, Diego..." he shakes his head, wanting to disbelieve, but unable.

Some time later, a polite, slightly embarrassed junior logistics technician from your crew gently knocks and informs you that the cargo is fully loaded.
You act as if you've had much more than you actually imbibed and make your excuses and promises as you pretend-stumble back to your transport shuttle.
Once the doors close, you stand up straight, dropping the act. The junior logistics technician does her best not to look too relieved.

You manage to decline repeated offers to share a bottle of 'the good stuff' while the boss iterates Diego's many failings. You nod and agree in vague but enthusiastic terms, performing your emotional support role with aplomb. 
Some time later, a polite, slightly embarrassed junior logistics technician knocks on the open doorway - there's no door - of the utility nook that passes for the boss's office to inform you that the cargo is fully loaded.
He insists on personally escorting you, a little unsteadily, to your shuttle's airlock and shakes your hand before you step inside. "It's people like you that make this job worth it, cap. Solid, trustworthy. Willing to step up."
The door seals with a thunk you feel through your boots; finally, relief.

"You there, captain. Yes, you know an honest face when you see one!" $HeOrShe gives a crooked smile, "Just look here," $heOrShe shoves the flickering display of the datapad into your hands: a cargo manifest consisting mostly of low-grade construction materials stored in a warehouse in a completely different system.
$HeOrShe leans in, and speaks quietly, motioning as if explaining the datapad's contents, "You help me move $smug_quantity units of $smug_commodityName to $smug_marketName, a quick hop of $smug_dist light-years.

As you approach, one of the cybermodded thugs steps in your way, a big metal smile at finally having a challenger to beat down. One of your bodyguards, subtly shadowing you just for such an occasion, steps up. 
Yours has better augs and training. Theirs, the brash scars of black-market mod infections and a fatal desire to prove that they can't be faced down. 
From the booth, a soft clapping begins. "A good show, very well done. Though I adore bloodsport, I've only barely touched my first drink." Then, to the thug, "You! Stand down- and you, captain. Join me."

A second glass of it sits before you, politely sipped and otherwise ignored. "Good guards, admirably professional. Well paid?" $HeOrShe lifts an eyebrow, and proceeds before you can respond. "I could use some of that. You see- most freebooters, brigands, pirates if you like; they're sloppy. They make a mess of things, it's all bang and noise and no follow-through."

The $jabr_manOrWoman looks you over as you approach. After a moment, $jabr_heOrShe seems satisfied and slides a cheap datapad across the table. It displays a personnel file and the schematics of a secure facility.
In a quiet voice $jabr_heOrShe explains, "I need an extract of the subject from, ah, unjust confinement $jabr_marketOnOrAt $jabr_marketName, $jabr_dist light-years away.

"Thank you captain," they give a wan smile as your guards lead them to a secure compartment, "I'm expected home now, I'm sure."

[Line 7590] You approach the smiling patron, who turns and keeps their eyes firmly locked at a menu display on the wall while a somewhat fanciful concoction appears on the bar.
"There are so many options, $playerName," they say deliberately. "Not everyone wants the same thing. Some disagree quite strongly, but are too polite to say so out loud." Eyes flicker to the door, then to a holodisplay of some news item about the leading political cadre of $jabr_marketName.

The timeline is short, delivery is promised before the next workshift begins, and you are almost as surprised as the prisoner looks as they are shoved out of a shadowy maintenance hatch toward you, hands still tied. The patron leans through and gives you a nod before resealing the hatch.
You move quickly to leave before the civic observation net flags your identities.

The $ddro_manOrWoman watches your approach. "You want in on the business, that right?" $heOrShe says, amused at your audacity.
"Let me give you a job so easy that any rad-addled spacer could manage it. But," $heOrShe shrugs regretfully, "It's a real shame how many of 'em just can't follow instructions and end up getting tossed out an airlock." $HeOrShe laughs like this is a good joke.
"Deliver the item to the specified location in $ddro_systemName, $ddro_dist light-years away." $HeOrShe flips a TriPad out of $hisOrHer coat. The display shows $ddro_aOrAnThing. "This is it. The reward is $ddro_reward credits. Don't be seen making the drop, and don't tell anyone about it."

"I'm celebrating!" $HeOrShe leans close, "A new find." $HeOrShe lifts $hisOrHer drink and turns, grinning, "Drink, drink! To my good fortune!" Enthusiasm for this self-toast is only moderate, though a crew of spacers well into their off-shift shouts encouragement.
$HeOrShe downs the drink while the spacers hoot, then turns back to you. "You look like you know your way through a jump-point," $heOrShe says, lowering $hisOrHer voice once more. "I know the location of $sitm_aOrAnItem, and so could you for the price of $sitm_price credits. Just need to hop over with your $shipOrFleet and take it. I'd go myself, but I have too much love for civilization." 
$HeOrShe taps $hisOrHer empty drink, looking for the bartender. "Interested?" $heOrShe asks casually.

$HeOrShe considers something for a moment, then relents, "I should also warn you that this informant, they are not completely reliable.

I have already sold this information to several other interested parties in order to maximize my profits. If you accept, be prepared to deal with these other treasure-seekers." $HeOrShe smiles in anticipation, "It will be far from the core worlds; you could burn their fleets from the sky, plunder their supplies, and none would be the wiser."

"You, on the other hand, need to get out of here... for your own health!"
$HeOrShe says this with smug sincerity, apparently confident that it'll have you turn around and flee at max burn. The comm link is abruptly terminated while you're still taking in $hisOrHer delivery of this threat.

[Line 7634] The comms-link crackles to life. "Greetings, star-farer!" $Rank $personName grimaces regretfully, "Bad news: you possess something my superiors desire and now you must surrender it to me."
You realize that $heOrShe is talking about $entity.fwt_thingDesc.
"Now, is this going to be easy or hard? Think, now," $heOrShe says with false charitably, "But don't take too long, please."
The demand is outright robbery and any law-abiding faction would be embarrassed to condemn you for defending yourself, if you chose to do so.

$Rank $personName clears $hisOrHer throat, "You have something my superior wants. I'm sure you know what it is. Hand it over now and I'll give you the $entity.fwt_payment credits my employers have generously set aside for this transaction." 
You realize that $heOrShe is, of course, talking about $entity.fwt_thingDesc.
$HeOrShe releases a breath, "That wasn't so bad, right? And you'll be paid for your trouble. Quite a deal." $HeOrShe taps $hisOrHer console idly, then looks up and adds "I shudder to consider having to kill you."

They've sent me all the way out here to pay you $entity.fwt_payment credits for handing it over to me for safekeeping."
You realize that $heOrShe is talking about $entity.fwt_thingDesc.

pirate complication, with Kanta bluff

[Line 7644] The display flickers with holo-snow before resolving into a swaggering pirate captain.
"Ah look at you there, what a fine $shipOrFleet. A little birdie told me you have $fwt_thingDesc and come next shift I'm going to be the one a-holding $fwt_itOrThem. Do you see my meaning, captain? It'd be a crying shame if anything happened to your fine $shipOrFleet."
$HeOrShe pretends to be pondering deeply, "Now, 'way I see this going, are you gonna make the smart choice and hand $fwt_itOrThem over all peaceful-like, or are you gonna be sucking vacuum after I blow your $shipOrFleet out of orbit? Think, now, think."

Your stare bores into the pirate like twin tachyon lances as you bellow your words, "You dare claim property of the Warlord Kanta?"
The blood drains from the pirate captain's face. "She... but... by, stars and blood. Captain, please accept my apologies! I would never... she doesn't need to hear of this, isn't that right? Please- please accept a token of $fwt_piratePayment credits for this unfortunate delay."
$HeOrShe is almost pleading now, "So, captain. Captain, you won't mention this little incident?"

[Line 7645] [Options Given: fwt_bluffPirate1:"We'll see."]

[Line 7646] [Option Selected: "We'll see."]
The pirate nods grimly, "Yes... yes of course." $HeOrShe studies you, attempting to divine if you'll tell Kanta of $hisOrHer transgression.
And if so, what steps might be taken to change one's name and appearance. Then, perhaps, the wisdom of crewing on a long salvage expedition on the fringe of the Persean Sector far, far away from anyone with the name 'Kanta'.
You take this cue to terminate the comms and roll your eyes at the pirate's cowardice.

"So you're just giving $fwt_itOrThem to me?" The pirate captain still looks skeptical. "Good, I suppose. Smart move. Very economical." $heOrShe mutters while confirming the handover on a battered datapad.
"That's that then, captain. No battle, no glory..." $heOrShe looks away wistfully, "It's these new times, I tell you. All business, no adventure, why back in-"

Luddic Path complication

[Line 7649] The comms flicker with snow, and as the $faction $rank begins to speak you realize it's due to ill-maintained equipment of the Pather flagship. 
"The blessed Path led me to you. Will you suffer the hammer and the sword? Or will you repent - by surrendering $entity.fwt_theThing, which you carry to no good end?"
"Don't think me a mere fanatic, captain," $heOrShe says. "I pray for heretic and apostate alike each day, and I pray now that I may destroy $entity.fwt_TheThing in cleansing vacuum rather the hellfire-death of your flagship. Accept my mercy."

You shock the Pather by seeming to accept $hisOrHer words at face value. Truly, $heOrShe prays for you?
You get the Pather explaining exactly how you've stumbled into a path of sin and how you might yet be saved. You nod, serious and appearing conflicted.
Meanwhile, your fingers type out precise instructions to your operations chief.

[Line 7650] [Options Given: fwt_bluffPather1:Continue]

Sounding almost in tears, you make a show of repenting, accepting a transmission of Luddic Path holovids - speeches by a Brother Cotton figure prominently in the files.
"It is time," the Pather says, "To take your first step." You nod, then turn and give the order to eject $entity.fwt_theThing so that it may be cleansed in the holy vacuum.
A blip drifts across the tactical display; the Pather blasts it into a spray of exotic particles.

"I'm here to give you $entity.fwt_payment credits." $HeOrShe smiles, perfectly. "Got your attention? Of course, of course; it's human nature." 
"However," $heOrShe holds up a hand and you note the strange affect of a ruinously expensive handmade mechanical wrist chronometer, "You shall have to give me something in return. Something I know that you have, $entity.fwt_thingDesc. A simple, fair trade. No threats, no deception, just an honest business dealing.

"Nothing could be easier. And here," a subtle flicker of cybernetic implants, "Is your payment."
"I sincerely hope that chance aligns such that we may do business again - and soon," $heOrShe says. "Bright stars and long burns. Be sure to add me on TriLink!"

"I see," $heOrShe says. "A missed opportunity. I sincerely believe that next time you'll see the efficacy of my proposal. Until then, bright stars and long burns." 
You start reaching to terminate the comms. "I nearly forgot," $heOrShe says quickly, "-be sure to add me on TriLink so that I can-"

"I have all the respect in the Sector for you, so I'll be direct about this: you've got something my employer has hired me to acquire from you by any means necessary." The merc shrugs, non-quite apologetic, "It's a living."
You realize the $heOrShe is talking about $entity.fwt_thingDesc.
"I'll give you a minute to think it through. Be a real pity if I had to slag your flagship over a trifle." $HeOrShe then leans back in $hisOrHer chair, humming something to $himOrHerself.

You realize the $heOrShe is talking about $entity.fwt_thingDesc.

So no threats, just an offer. And if you don't take it," $heOrShe shrugs, "Well, then I don't get my bonus. So please do consider it." 
"Which brings me to you. My employers would like to pay you $fwt_payment credits for something you alone have. I think," $heOrShe says coyly, "You know what it is." $entity.fwt_ThingDesc.

[Line 7694] You enter the ID, hand hovering over a glowing 'confirm' sigil. Your comms officer nods, ready to respond to whatever surprises Gargoyle thinks would be amusing to send through the link this time.
The display resolves from a mesmerizing fractal battleground to a familiar face grinning impishly at you. "Ah, $playerFirstName! Are you back to find something interesting to do? I've got all sorts of wonderful ideas."

Luddic

[Line 7699] The Excubitor Orbis appears before you.
"Captain $playerName," he says by way of greeting, a stern gaze already fixed on you.
The moment draws longer. He seems determined to make you speak first.

[Line 7699] [Options Given: 0:cutCommLinkPolite:Cut the comm link]

[Line 7701] You speak first with some kind of secretary who politely persuades you to wait patiently.
After a short time, the image of the Archcurate Jaspis appears. She makes little effort to look toward comms feed as she putters around her office.
"We are blessed by the day," she says.

[Line 7701] [Options Given: 0:cutCommLinkPolite:Cut the comm link]

[Line 7703] The comms system provided by the Knights of Ludd for its members appears to be intentionally low-bandwidth. 
"Good day, captain," he says, voice hollowed of its usual warmth.

"We shall pray on this matter."

[Line 7710] [Option Selected: Offer heavy armaments for the insurgency]
"A donation directly to... those in need... would be most welcome." 
In roundabout language, Curate Sacraria Standfast explains that her network could move 10 units of heavy armaments to the surface. There is, however, a risk of generating suspicion from the Sindrian Diktat authorities.

[Line 7721] After an interminable time watching a Hegemony logo, the comm-link connects you with what appears to be a junior cadet. You suspect they haven't even graduated from the naval academy.
"Hello citizen," the cadet chirps at you brightly, "You've reached the office of the High Hegemon. Tour bookings of the Hegemon Council campus are currently unavailable. If you'd like to know more about how you can assist the restoration of the Domain, please accept the informational packet upload now."

[Line 7725] [Option Selected: Download the holo experience]
"I hope you enjoy this tasteful celebration of the Hegemony's history," the cadet says, "From the heroic flight of Admiral Molina to save the Persean Sector from collapse to the victory of High Hegemon Daud over the Tri-Tachyon and AI invaders."

[Line 7731] [Options Given: tseenKe_askDaud:"What do you think of the High Hegemon, Baikal Daud?"]

[Line 7732] [Option Selected: "What's your impression of Admiral Orcus Rao?"]
"Admiral Rao?" Tseen Ke rubs his chin. "He's a bit of a fancy lad, is Rao. Out of Eventide, did you know? Of course you do, it's right there in the name, ha-ha. They're rich, beyond rich. He's not a bad one though, not bad."
"He does things his own way to win, and he's won plenty." He lowers his voice - not that it particularly matters over the comms-link, which automatically compensates for volume.
"I tell you, if he weren't a Rao..."

[Line 7732] [Options Given: tseenKe_askRao2:Continue]

[Line 7733] [Option Selected: Continue]
"If he weren't a Rao, he wouldn't have got away with half of what he did. It'd be court martial, stripped of command and rank. If I tried what he did, my only command would be over disinfection duty for the next 10 cycles."
He shrugs. "That's how it is though. Like I said, he's not bad."

[Line 7734] [Option Selected: "What do you think of the High Hegemon, Baikal Daud?"]
"What is this question, did INTSEC send you to check my loyalty? Ha-ha." 
Does the jocular affect cover an edge in his voice?

[Line 7735] [Options Given: tseenKe_askDaudSelA:"Ha-ha, of course not." (stare intently)]

[Line 7736] [Options Given: tseenKe_askDaudSelB:"Do they really send INTSEC to check on your loyalty?"]

[Line 7737] [Options Given: tseenKe_askDaudSelC:"No, I'm really interested in your perspective on the man."]

[Line 7738] "How about yourself, captain?" He turns the question around with cheerful bluster.
"Are you up or down on the Old Man? Not like we get a vote on it, ha-ha."

[Line 7738] [Options Given: tseenKe_askDaudOpA:"It's not my place to judge."
tseenKe_askDaudOpB:"He's practical. Knows how to keep his feet on the deck."
tseenKe_askDaudOpC:"He should be bolder. The Hegemony has great power, he should use it!"
tseenKe_askDaudOpD:"I think he's in over his head. Maybe it's his background, maybe his character."
tseenKe_askDaudOpE:"Honestly, I could do a better job as High Hegemon."
tseenKe_askDaudOpF:"Someone like Orcus Rao should be in charge. He knows when to bend the rules."]

[Line 7740] "Let's leave the old man alone," he says. "He's got enough problems."

[Line 7741] [Option Selected: "Ha-ha, of course not." (stare intently)]
"Ha... ha."
His half-hearted chuckle dies into an awkward silence.
"Captain, you're not... no," he shakes his head. "You were saying something about the Hegemon?"

[Line 7742] [Option Selected: "Do they really send INTSEC to check on your loyalty?"]
"They, uh..." He glances to the side.
"Well, not like that. INTSEC does... I believe track certain queries, communications, and so on to combat, you know, the usual sort of thing. Terrorists, mutiny, treason..."
He trails off with a distant look. Then shakes his head.
"They're a bunch of grim sticks, that's a truth for you. But they're not going to bother battering my hatch for making a joke or two. If they did, half the brass and all the hands'd be traitors, ha-ha."

[Line 7743] [Option Selected: "No, I'm really interested in your perspective on the man."]
"Ah, he's my Hegemon!" He thumps his chest for emphasis.
"Old Man Daud came up from the bottom of Chicomoztoc and climbed all the way to the top. Didn't matter what the aristos on Eventide thought, there was a war on, and he went about winning it. Not on his lonesome, of course, but it was him that saved the big Mozzy. Without Mozzy, there's no Hegemony. Without Mozzy, there's no Persean Sector, no future at all. That's not something to shake your head at."

[Line 7744] [Option Selected: "It's not my place to judge."]
"Oh, ho- you're a diplomat now, are you? Suit yourself."

[Line 7745] [Option Selected: "He's practical. Knows how to keep his feet on the deck."]
"Aye, that's right!" Caliban thumps his console. "That's why he's the old man! None of those flighty notions aristos and academicians love dreaming up."

[Line 7746] [Option Selected: "He should be bolder. The Hegemony has great power, he should use it!"]
"Well..." Caliban rubs his head. "You're right on that, the Hegemony- we've got the guns, the best minds to aim 'em, and the best hands to fire 'em!"
"And," he grins, "If they're not the best, no matter. We've got more of all of 'em than anyone else in the big Mozzy alone!"
"As for the old man..." He settles down a little as your subtle criticism of Daud sinks in. "See, even if we've got more than anyone, he cares about us, right? He won't throw us away. The aristos might be inclined, but we're his people."

[Line 7746] [Options Given: tseenKe_askDaudOpC2:"You don't think sacrifices are ever necessary?"]

[Line 7747] [Option Selected: "You don't think sacrifices are ever necessary?"]
He sits back, puffs his cheeks out and blows air. As if to dispense with the heavy implications.
"That's above my pay-grade, captain. And I'm thankful for it." A grim looks crosses his face. "If Daud asks it, I'll do it. That much I'll say."

[Line 7748] [Option Selected: "I think he's in over his head. Maybe it's his background, maybe his character."]
"Captain," Caliban shakes his head. "I don't think that's fair to the old man."
"Now, you're entitled to your opinion on the matter, don't get me wrong. That's part of the Hegemony, we can have our own thoughts and our words- within reasonable limits considering the emergency of course."
"But Daud? He's given everything and made the best of a bad situation, and," he pre-emptively raises a hand to ward off any objections. "He's done it under pressure."

[Line 7749] [Option Selected: "Honestly, I could do a better job as High Hegemon."]
"Ha-ha! Could you now? I've heard that said often enough in the mess over one thing or another."
"Those are easy words when there's a logistics mixup or you're on the short end of command policy," Caliban says, taking on a philosophical tone. "But to be up there and have to make the call that's most right for all the millions? The higher you are, the more someone's always on the short end of your decision."

[Line 7750]  "Lot of stress, that. No right decision, sometimes. It makes enemies no matter what you do, sometimes." He shakes his head. "No, I'm best pleased where Command decides I should be. My problems are small and I can set 'em aside after a liter of beer and get a good sleep."
"Hear me, captain," he looks at you more seriously. "You don't want that."

[Line 7751] [Option Selected: "Someone like Orcus Rao should be in charge. He knows when to bend the rules."]
"Ohhh, well now..." He rubs his chin. "He's a bit of a fancy lad, is Admiral Rao. Though not a bad one, not bad."
"Maybe when it's the old man's time to step aside," Caliban speaks with a shrug. "Rao wouldn't be so bad, maybe."

[Line 7756] After a short wait spent watching propaganda blurbs scroll past the crest of the Hegemony navy, the comm-link connects you with the office of Admiral Rao.
"So," the hero of the Siege of Raesvelg looks you over. "What's a freelancer doing at this backwater outpost?"

He blows some air out through his nostrils, barely a laugh.
"Trading tired banter with you, it appears." He makes a show of checking a secondary display- for the time, perhaps.
"I am busy, if you can believe it. Perhaps you had something useful, or at least interesting to say?"

pulled a fast one in his name

[Line 7784] The link opens with a surprisingly brief wait for an officer of Rao's rank. He appears with the hint of an amused smile.
"$PlayerName! I see you've carried out my orders to the letter. Great work," he says, seemingly earnest.
"Perhaps I should award you a medal for your service?"

rao_fastOneB:"Yes, I think a medal would be in order."]

[Line 7785] [Option Selected: "What in the worlds are you talking about?"]
His eyes glitter frostily.
"I'm talking about a liar." His finger flicks to point at you.
"The one with the gall to open a comm link to my face after I received a most fascinating report from one of our fleet commanders about an encounter during an emergency intercept near Tse Franchise Station."

[Line 7785] [Options Given: rao_fastOneCa:"Oh, I remember now."
rao_fastOneCb:"That must have been a different $playerName."]

[Line 7786] [Option Selected: "Yes, I think a medal would be in order."]
"No." His amused tone has grown a touch of frost.
He looks aside as he speaks. "I think not. They don't give medals for lying in the Hegemony..."
Then he holds a finger to his lips, thoughtfully. "No, that's not true. Not at all. They don't give medals for lying TO the Hegemony."
He smiles again, turning back to you.

[Line 7786] [Options Given: rao_fastOneB2a:"When did I ever lie to the Hegemony?" (feign innocence)
rao_fastOneB2b:"Is this about that fleet looking for Gargoyle after I left Tse Franchise Station?"]

[Line 7787] [Option Selected: "When did I ever lie to the Hegemony?" (feign innocence)]
He breaks out in a hearty laugh, taking a moment before he rubs his eyes. 
"Yes, yes, very good." Rao lets his hands fall deliberately to his console.
"You lied when you encountered the absolute oaf in command of the fleet ordered to intercept you, transporting a hacker wanted by the Hegemony, away from Tse Franchise Station."

[Line 7787] [Options Given: rao_fastOneCa:"Oh, I remember now."

rao_fastOneCc:"Don't blame them too much, I can be pretty convincing when I want to be."]

He waves the thought away, then takes in a deep breath, quiet now, and drums his fingers on his console. Staring at you. Assessing.
"Let us speak plainly," he says.

[Line 7790] [Option Selected: "Well. Sorry."]

rao_fastOneCa2:"That'd be the High Hegemon, Baikal Daud."]

[Line 7793] [Option Selected: "That'd be the High Hegemon, Baikal Daud."]
"One should think," he says pointedly. "But never mind- what I mean to say is that you played the ruse well."
"Better than a puffed-up uniform of the sort Eventide seems to spawn each cycle would. You remind me a bit of myself when I was younger and didn't have to sit at a desk."

[Line 7793] [Options Given: rao_fastOneSpeak:Continue]

[Line 7794] [Option Selected: "That must have been a different $playerName."]
Rao laughs, though there's more of an edge...
You take a moment to try to form a judgement - if he really thinks this is funny, he can't be too angry, right? Or is he one of those officers that keeps others off guard with calculated shifts in mood? From what you know - mostly holodocs - Rao has a cunning streak and a bit of a mixed reputation among the more respectable segments of the Hegemony.
Rao takes in a deep breath, quiet now, and drums his fingers on his console. Staring at you. Assessing.
"Let us speak plainly," he says.

"You played it well," he says.

"I trust you weren't hurt too badly? The night of the ball."

[Line 7816] [Option Selected: "No. I've had worse." (lie)]
He raises an eyebrow.
"Well. It's a mark on the Rao name that it came to that. Augusta let things get out of hand."
Orcus Rao sighs, and looking distant, says "I cannot apologize for her, as she's never sought my council in the matter of 'her' house."

[Line 7816] [Options Given: rao_nerieneSelWonA2:Continue]

[Line 7817] [Option Selected: "No. I've had worse."]
"I do believe Augusta let things get out of hand, but she never sought my council in the matters of 'her' house. So I can't very well apologize for her- it's a mark on the Rao name."

[Line 7817] [Options Given: rao_nerieneSelWonA2:Continue]

[Line 7818] [Option Selected: "Just my pride, perhaps. But don't worry, it's more than recovered."]
A smile appears. "I am glad to hear it."
The smile fades. "But it is a mark on the Rao name that it came to that. Augusta let things get out of hand."
Orcus Rao sighs, and looking distant, says "I cannot apologize for her, as she's never sought my council in the matter of 'her' house."

[Line 7818] [Options Given: rao_nerieneSelWonA2:Continue]

[Line 7819] [Option Selected: "What matters is I stood to their insults and fought. My honor is intact."]
"That you did," he says approvingly. "Some would say you were foolish, but it was an act of bravery to face a blooding as you did."
He looks aside, troubled. "Still, it is a mark on the Rao name that it came to that. Augusta let things get out of hand. I cannot apologize for her, as she's never sought my council in the matter of 'her' house..."

[Line 7819] [Options Given: rao_nerieneSelWonA2:Continue]

[Line 7820] [Option Selected: "They chose to make me their enemy long before that night."]
"Mm. I suppose the fact that it wasn't truly a personal matter is little consolation for the provocation which Augusta allowed in 'our' family home."
Orcus Rao sighs, and looks distant for a moment. "But I won't apologize for her. She's never sought my council in the matters of 'her' house..."

[Line 7821] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Regardless," he claps his hands together. "The seasonal ball is a lovely time to visit Eventide, and I recall such occasions at House Rao fondly. Setting aside the unpleasantness, I'm sure there was some proper revelry."

[Line 7823] [Option Selected: "Someone had to put those aristocratic bullies in their place."]
"And impressively so, I hear. Not from Neriene, of course." He smirks. Though there's a touch of... sadness? He speaks before you're certain.
"Though mind, captain, those were no mere 'thugs'. The Cardonas hold a grudge, and one of their own sits on the Strategic Assembly."

[Line 7823] [Options Given: rao_nerieneSelWonC2a:"The Strategic Assembly of the Hegemony? That could be inconvenient."
rao_nerieneSelWonC2b:"I'm not worried about the Strategic Assembly."]

[Line 7824] [Option Selected: "The Strategic Assembly of the Hegemony? That could be inconvenient."]
"It could," Rao concedes. "Though they're a faction known to have little favor from Baikal." His eyes dart to you, "The High Hegemon of course. Nonetheless, he must make concessions from time to time..."
He pauses, thoughtful. "Say what you will of Baikal. He won't do it lightly, but he knows when to sacrifice a pawn."

[Line 7824] [Options Given: rao_nerieneSelWonC2a2a:"I'll keep that in mind."
rao_nerieneSelWonC2a2b:"What's a 'pawn'?"]

[Line 7825] [Option Selected: "I'll keep that in mind."]
He waits a moment, his look grim. As if he might say more. But he holds back, quite deliberately.

[Line 7826] [Option Selected: "What's a 'pawn'?"]
"Someone easily spent when the cost is dear," he says. "They are not generally aware of their status."
He waits out the moment, his look grim. As if he might say more. But he holds back, quite deliberately.

[Line 7827] [Option Selected: "I'm not worried about the Strategic Assembly."]
Rao seems to examine you. "I have always found that putting an enemy out of mind is like walking into an ambush of your own making."
He shrugs, "But perhaps you'll be lucky." He gets a sly look. "I was."

[Line 7827] [Options Given: rao_nerieneSelWonC3a:"I'll watch my back."
rao_nerieneSelWonC3b:"I'll be sure to decline the next invitation to House Rao's seasonal ball."
rao_nerieneSelWonC3c:"'Perhaps'? I'm counting on it!"]

[Line 7828] [Option Selected: "I'll watch my back."]
He nods. "To be true, it was Augusta who should never have allowed that to happen. The seasonal ball is a lovely time to visit Eventide, and I recall such occasions at House Rao fondly. Setting aside the unpleasantness, I'm sure there was some proper revelry."

[Line 7829] [Option Selected: "I'll be sure to decline the next invitation to House Rao's seasonal ball."]
He laughs. "Even with Augusta doing her best to spoil it, I recall such times at House Rao fondly. Setting aside the unpleasantness, I'm sure there was some proper revelry."

[Line 7830] [Option Selected: "'Perhaps'? I'm counting on it!"]
Orcus Rao shakes his head. "It's clear you're of your own mind. So let us speak of other matters."

[Line 7832] [Option Selected: "And easily. Those brutes did not realize that I had studied the blade.";['rao_nerieneSelLostBlade']]
"You have? Neriene made no mention." He leans forward. "How interesting. It is something of a lost art outside of the more traditional families of Eventide."
"Tell me, do you prefer the Hadi-style hilt or the Andreas?

[Line 7832] [Options Given: rao_nerieneSelWonDa:"Hadi, naturally. I'm a little old-school that way."
rao_nerieneSelWonDb:"Andreas, of course. The flexibility is paramount."
rao_nerieneSelWonDc:"The Jung-Sook, actually. I believe it's been unfairly discounted."]

[Line 7833] [Option Selected: "Hadi, naturally. I'm a little old-school that way."]
"The Hadi is a fine choice, and my own in fact," he says, pleased. "Now let me tell you..."

[Line 7834] [Option Selected: "Andreas, of course. The flexibility is paramount."]
He gives a laugh. "I daresay, $playerSirOrMadam, I am not the least bit surprised to hear you say that. Let me tell you..."

[Line 7835] [Option Selected: "The Jung-Sook, actually. I believe it's been unfairly discounted."]
"How unusual!" He looks perplexed, and intrigued.
"I've only ever met one, maybe two, who shared your preference, but let me tell you..."

You proceed to have a lengthy discussion on the finer points of hardware and technique with Orcus Rao.
He is more than an enthusiast, showing great depths of knowledge and obvious practical experience on the subject. Your own perspective is a worthy match for his, and you find that you have more to agree than disagree about. 
It is satisfying to meet a mind as sharp as Rao's on a favored subject. The feeling is mutual, you can tell. 

[Line 7836] [Options Given: rao_nerieneSelWonD3:Continue]

[Line 7837] [Option Selected: Continue]
After some time, your talk lulls. Admiral Rao speaks, idly, "How ever did we get here?"

[Line 7837] [Options Given: rao_nerieneSelWonD4:"The duel."]

[Line 7838] [Option Selected: "The duel."]
"Of course," he says with a sigh.

[Line 7840] [Option Selected: "I did not go to House Rao to start a brawl, sir."]
"To your credit, captain, I'm sure," he says. "Though it is a mark on the Rao name that it came to that. Augusta let things get out of hand."
Orcus Rao sighs, and looking distant, says "I cannot apologize for her, as she's never sought my council in the matter of 'her' house."

[Line 7842] [Option Selected: ['rao_nerieneSelLeftA2', '$player.soe_wasNiceToNeriene']]
He pauses. "At least, that is how Neriene described it."
He's watching you closely.

[Line 7842] [Options Given: rao_nerieneConvOut2:"Then she spoke to you... about me?"
rao_nerieneConvOut1:"Not my concern."]

[Line 7843] [Option Selected: ['rao_nerieneSelLeftA2', '$player.soe_wasRudeToNeriene']]
He pauses a moment. "Though Neriene doesn't quite see it that way. She had... some words."

rao_nerieneConvOut1:"Not my concern."]

rao_nerieneConvOut1:"Not my concern."]

[Line 7846] [Option Selected: "Did I? It was a cowardly exit."]
He half-shrugs, his expression charitable despite the fact that he appears to agree with your words.
"I heard that certain young men were keen to provoke you to a confrontation. It is a mark upon the House of Rao that it was allowed to go as far as it did."

[Line 7846] [Options Given: rao_nerieneConvOut4:Continue]

[Line 7847] [Option Selected: "It was looked upon poorly, but I had to think of Neriene."]
"Oh, I assure you it was a wasted gesture. Neriene Rao can handle herself- with the blade, or without." He looks away, smiling. It quickly fades.

[Line 7847] [Options Given: rao_nerieneConvOut4:Continue]

[Line 7848] [Option Selected: "It's a stupid tradition anyway. Who fights with oversized knives in this age?"]
"We do." Wrinkles form at his eyes as Orcus Rao doesn't quite smile.
"Such traditions are necessarily arbitrary. The question falls to whether one chooses to excel within its terms... or without. The swordplay of Eventide is no different."

[Line 7848] [Options Given: rao_nerieneConvOut4:Continue]

[Line 7849] [Option Selected: "Bad words?"]
"They were... colorful. You did not make an enemy, I think, but you certainly did not make a friend."
"Anyway," he waves dismissively.
"Her mind is her business. Let us speak of other matters."

[Line 7850] [Option Selected: "Not my concern."]
"Indeed it is not," he says, waving the thought away.

[Line 7851] [Option Selected: "She spoke to you about... that evening?"]
"She did," he says, holding you with a look for a long moment. Then says, "Her mind is her business, of course."

[Line 7852] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Neriene was a talent. Her rebellion by way of abandoning the art..." He looks away.
"It struck true," he says quietly, putting a hand on his chest. "Anyway, you don't need an old man like me to tell you what to think. Her mind is her own business."

[Line 7853] He is quiet for a moment, eyes on you. "A thought occurs..."

[Line 7854] He folds his hands together. "Let us speak of other things."

Orcus Rao, Post SDTU

[Line 7856] [Options Given: rao_askDiktatMerc2:"A merc on the Askonia fringe told me to visit Ragnar. I assume that means you."]

[Line 7857] [Option Selected: "A merc on the Askonia fringe told me to visit Ragnar. I assume that means you."]
"Is that so," he says, nonchalant. "I wonder why they would have said that."

[Line 7857] [Options Given: rao_askDiktatMerc3:"I think they were working for you. And under orders not to say so."]

[Line 7858] [Option Selected: "I think they were working for you. And under orders not to say so."]
He raises an eyebrow, his affect still casual.
"If I had hired this mercenary, I imagine I'd be pretty upset at how easily they gave up the identity of their employer. It's a good thing the Hegemony has an official policy forbidding the employ of mercs."

[Line 7858] [Options Given: rao_askDiktatMerc4a:"What? The Hegemony regularly employs mercenaries."
rao_askDiktatMerc4b:"If it's a fight against the Diktat, I want to be a part of it."
rao_askDiktatMerc4c:"Looks like someone is losing their bonus. Anyway, I want in."
rao_askDiktatMerc4d:"Clearly you don't take this very seriously."]

[Line 7859] [Option Selected: "What? The Hegemony regularly employs mercenaries."]
"Really?" Admiral Rao, leaning forward, puts on a look of concern.
He speaks officiously. "As a patriotic citizen, I'm sure you'll have reported all such lapses of policy so that official action may be taken."
The pose holds for a moment, then half a smile cracks through.

[Line 7860] [Option Selected: "Clearly you don't take this very seriously."]
He shrugs, holding his ironic half-smile in place. Behind it his eyes are cold, very cold.

[Line 7860] [Options Given: rao_askDiktatMerc4b:"If it's a fight against the Diktat, I want to be a part of it."
rao_askDiktatMerc4c:"Looks like someone is losing their bonus. Anyway, I want in."
rao_askDiktatMerc4out:"Right. I don't have time for this."]

[Line 7861] [Option Selected: "Right. I don't have time for this."]
"Then I bid you a good day, captain."
Rao flicks the comms cut-off.

[Line 7863] [Option Selected: "If it's a fight against the Diktat, I want to be a part of it."]
"Hmm." Rao looks you over. Is that a twinkle of amusement?
"Why?"
He leaves the silence for you to fill.

[Line 7864] [Options Given: rao_askDiktatMerc5merc:"Because you'll pay me well, and on time. You were a freelancer, you know the life."]

[Line 7865] [Options Given: rao_askDiktatMerc5order:"They're mutineers. They undermine the restoration of the Domain, the Hegemony's purpose."]

[Line 7869] [Option Selected: "Because you'll pay me well, and on time. You were a freelancer, you know the life."]
He nods, eyes closed. "I will, I was, and I do." His eyes open, and he says "That's not all, though."

[Line 7870] [Option Selected: "They're mutineers. They undermine the restoration of the Domain, the Hegemony's purpose."]
He stares at you, a puzzled look on his face. "You're a believer, then. Huh." Rao rubs his chin.

[Line 7871] [Option Selected: "They're brutal oppressors, enemies of freedom and life. It's a just cause.]
He nods, watching you. "Got the fire, I see. Good."

[Line 7872] [Option Selected: "They're systematically killing the Faithful, they closed the Shrine of Volturn. My duty is to resist."]
"Huh. Met Standfast, did you? I like her."

[Line 7873] [Option Selected: "They're systematically killing the Faithful, they closed the Shrine of Volturn. My duty is to resist."]
"Huh," he looks aside. "Met Standfast, did you? I like her."
Rao makes a sly smile. "It's you who's been giving her some big guns, hasn't it."

[Line 7873] [Options Given: rao_pitchTest:Continue]

[Line 7874] [Option Selected: "Because they're falling apart. They're going to lose and I like being on the winning side."]
"Is your loyalty so contingent? I suppose that is true for many, perhaps most- and almost all are loathe to admit it. How brave, then, to admit it." His tone is rhetorical, and rather more sardonic than earnest.
Rao looks to you again. "Nonetheless, I agree with your assessment of the enemy."

[Line 7874] [Options Given: rao_pitchTest:Continue]

[Line 7877] [Options Given: rao_askDiktatName:"Dolos Macario mentioned your name. Why is he interested in you specifically?"]

[Line 7878] [Option Selected: "Dolos Macario mentioned your name. Why is he interested in you specifically?"]
"Maybe he's an admirer of my talent?"
"Speaking of interests." Rao's posture improves dramatically, and now he adopts the posture of the admiral he is. "I'm interested in why you're having such intimate conversations with Dolos Macario."

[Line 7879] [Options Given: rao_askDiktatDolosOptA:"He... recruited me into his scheme and one thing led to another. I'm not really sure."]

[Line 7885] [Option Selected: "He... recruited me into his scheme and one thing led to another. I'm not really sure."]
"So you just... went along?"
He shakes his head, looking perplexed.

[Line 7889] [Option Selected: "I figure I could take over the Sindrian Diktat if I played this right."]
"Really?" He looks legitimately perplexed. "An outsider with no connection to the ruling clique or official ideology swoops in and claims executive control based on... what, force alone?"
Rao taps his chin, considering. "I see where you got the idea, of course. But warfleets aside, you do lack connections with certain factions of the local elite. And you've not benefited from 20 cycles of the Hegemony propaganda machine building you up as the savior of human civilization."

[Line 7889] [Options Given: rao_askDiktatDolosOptE2:Continue]

[Line 7890] [Option Selected: Continue]
"No." He shakes his head. "I don't think so."
"If you were lucky you could be another Loke or Leonis. But they never built anything, they only destroyed. And how they died..."
Rao gives you a look- is that how you want to end up?

[Line 7891] [Option Selected: "I'm not answering that."]
"Then you will have no answers in return," he says.

[Line 7898] Option(s) Selected: ['rao_askDiktat1']
"The 'Sindrian Mutiny' is an interest of all officers of the Hegemony, I should think."
His look becomes more severe.

[Line 7906] [Option Selected: "Oxana Hyder. Think she'd come back?"]
"Maybe," Rao grunts. His look is uncharitable. "What you must ask is, does the Hegemony want her back? Yes- in an isolation cell. To begin with."
"We don't look well upon mutiny in the Hegemony, captain. Especially not mutinies that last for over 20 cycles."

"You've got promise, captain, that's true. But," he takes on an avuncular tone, "I don't think you've got enough experience to handle what I've got in mind."
"Put yourself out there, take on some jobs. We may speak again on this later."
His tone makes it clear that the issue is settled. For now.

[Line 7911] [Option Selected: "I think you might have work for me."]
"You've got promise, captain." He pauses. "And I believe you have the experience to handle what I've got in mind."

[Line 7913] [Option Selected: "I think you might have work for me."]

He pauses. "It speaks well for you, for what I have in mind."

[Line 7913] [Options Given: rao_pitchOffer:"And what do you have in mind?"]

[Line 7914] [Option Selected: "I think you might have work for me."]
"You've got promise, captain. You were brave enough to take up the sword with full knowledge of the art, fight... and lose. Your blood was spilled for honor in personal combat. That is more than most can say."
He pauses. "It speaks well for you, for what I have in mind."

[Line 7914] [Options Given: rao_pitchOffer:"And what do you have in mind?"]

[Line 7915] [Option Selected: "I think you might have work for me."]
"You've found lucrative employment of a sort with the Tri-Tachyon corporation, however."
He leans back. "We could discuss this matter again if that situation were to change."

[Line 7916] [Option Selected: "I think you might have work for me."]
"Huh." He chews on his lip.
"Why not ask your boss, Dolos Macario, for a job? I'm sure he's got some dissidents to space."

[Line 7917] [Options Given: rao_pitchDiktatCom3a:"Who is Dolos?"

[Line 7919] [Option Selected: "Who is Dolos?"]
"He calls himself the 'The Spider of Sindria', but that's not right," Rao says. "He's a self-satisfied little worm that's chewed his way into the rotten heart of the Sindrian Diktat. You should meet him."
Rao's smile is cold.
"Go. Meet him. Go on, now." He makes a shoo motion, then slaps the comms cut-off.

[Line 7920] [Option Selected: "I take it that's a 'no'."]
"Correct," he says icily.
He makes a shoo motion. "Off with you."
The comms cut.

[Line 7921] [Option Selected: "I just take Diktat money. I'm a mercenary. Like you were."]
"You're not like me," he says. "I was a mercenary, yes. But that was not all I was. And it is not all I am."
"I am a Rao," his voice is full and strong. "I am an officer of the Hegemony Navy despite the best efforts of a few among us who love rules and uniforms more than they love the service and the cause."
He sits back down, a piercing and newly earnest look fixed on you.

"Hah," Orcus Rao says, rolling his eyes. "We got another one."
He makes a shoo motion. "Off with you."

"As you bear the commission of the Persean League..." He makes a half-shrug. "I can't have you in a position of divided loyalty."
"Let us speak again on the matter if your situation changes."
His tone makes it clear that the issue is settled. For now.

[Line 7926] [Option Selected: "I think you might have work for me."]
"Seeing as you're a full, albeit junior, member of the Persean League we can't have you in a position of divided loyalty, can we."
He produces a little shrug. "Let us speak again on the matter if your situation changes."
His tone makes it clear that the issue is settled. For now.

[Line 7927] [Option Selected: "I think you might have work for me."]
"Seeing as you're a full, albeit junior, member of the Persean League... well, we can't very well divide your loyalties."
"Besides," a fleeting smile appears. "I see you've fallen into Reynard Hannan's orbit. An ego of that size produces a gravity well which is very difficult to escape."

"Of course."
He sits back, face falling into shadow.

"But you made the deal," Rao says impishly. "You didn't have to."

[Line 7931] [Options Given: rao_pitchNopeFirm:Continue]

[Line 7932] [Option Selected: "Reynard is a great man. I follow him gladly."]

Rao raises an eyebrow, his expression amused.

"It is possible our work together would serve certain common goals."

"The Hegemony is no stranger to making common cause with the Church of Galactic Redemption..." He makes a half-shrug, then pauses to look right at you.
"It's the guns you've given Standfast," his words are precise, "that convince me of your dedication."
He looks away, casual again. "If you can put up with me, I can deal with your god-bothering."

"Ludd, I think, doesn't need self-appointed curates to shield the Faith from my little comments," he says, his eyes suddenly sharp. "Pray on the matter. I insist."
He leans back, and his face falls into shadow.

"The truth makes few friends." Rao produces a wry smile.
"I never could stand a fool, especially when they're members of the Strategic Assembly. So," he holds his hand out to indicate his surroundings, Ragnar Complex.
"It's not so bad."

[Line 7952] [Option Selected: "What sort of work do you need done?"]
"A proper officer of the Hegemony is taught to leap toward the enemy, blazing guns. Once the noise quiets down, they'll wait, slack-jawed, for the medals to get pinned to their uniforms." 
"Such is the way of the Domain, which we must uphold."
He half-raises a finger, a quirk on his lips. "Officially," he concludes.

"Baikal was kind enough to find me a place where I could get important work done. I deal with... let us call them 'unique circumstances'. And for this I find it necessary to have energetic freelancers available."

"Then, perhaps something big will come up. When it does, I want to know I can count on you."

[Line 7954] [Option Selected: "What are these 'unique circumstances'? What is your goal?"]
"I'm offering you the chance to be the grit that throws history off its axis."
He lets a sly smile fade. "There are many bodies of power turning just now. Slowly grinding away, warships and bombings and riots and resources."
"The Persean Sector needs change, or it will grind what's left of us to dust."

[Line 7955] [Option Selected: "Is this about taking down the Sindrian Diktat?"]
A cold, quick expression passes over his face.
"Let us say that I'd be as satisfied as any Hegemony officer to cut down that pompous traitor. Setting aside even the matter of honor, I have a personal dislike of the man."

[Line 7956] [Option Selected: "Why is it personal with Andrada?"]
Rao lets out a slow breath. "That's talk for old comrades, over drink."
He leans back, not quite committing to a frown.
"Patience, captain."

[Line 7957] [Option Selected: "Weren't you court-martialed for Raesleg?"]
"There's rules to break when you need to win, and there's betrayal. These are very different things, fundamentally so, captain. He and I have done the former, but he threw away his honor with the latter."
"We are not. the. same." Rao's words come out slow, and cold. 


[Line 7958] [Option Selected: "I accept."]
"Good," his approval comes with a sly smile. "Have your people set up secure comms. We'll show the Strategic Assembly how it's done."

[Line 7959] [Option Selected: "I'm not so sure about this."]
"Let us speak again on the matter if your situation changes."

"Of course; the Protocols are-" She catches herself and looks just a little embarrassed. "I mean to say, we continue to follow the principles, yes. We are receiving updated training to bring the settlement in line with current doctrine, as per the personal request of the High Hegemon."
She sits up just a little straighter, as if Baikal Daud is, perhaps, keeping an eye on her.

[Line 7968] "I would like to extend the thanks of myself and our colony for your technical assistance," Commander Skiron beams as she speaks.
"The crew you left with us are ready to return to your $shipOrFleet; my quartermaster shall coordinate transport with your subordinates," she says.
"Well, ah. Most of them will be returning. A few have come to... other accommodations in their time among us, and we honor their contribution to our world."

You leave four guards and the pilot at your shuttle. Two more guards follow you, and the lanky pirate lieutenant sent to meet you nods that this is correct.
You're led through a primary access corridor toward the center of the station. You adjust quickly to disjointed agrav fields, an effect you suspect is intentional as ranks of pirates of all shapes and ages eye you for weakness, murmuring crude comments and jostling for prestige.

You can almost pick out a pattern of relations in their faces - this is a family business - and in their anarchic uniforms. They're bedecked in prizes, modified combat armor plated with gold and gems, stolen high-end vacsuits redone in off-brand colors, Tri-Tachyon neck-scarves crudely knotted; ostentatious luxury wear. They wear their wealth on the outside, the more garish the better.

Past pitted blast doors hung with crimson skull-banners, a large bay opens. The lingering acrid scent of energy weapon discharge hangs in the air, almost but not quite concealing the odor of rotting meat.
You're brought before what can only be described as a throne, tastelessly backlit in blood-red for maximum effect. The caps, badges, and insignia of various naval officers are impaled on fused blossoms of trophy weapons. You recognize kit from all of the polities of the Persean Sector.

Above all is the hissing, thrumming figure of Warlord Jorien Kanta, more machine now than human. Her face is a mask. What skin you can see is leathery like the rad scarring of old spacers.

Her head tracks you. "Kanta will hear you."

Two guards accompany you onto the station while the rest wait with the shuttle. This is how it is done here.
You're led by one of Kanta's lieutenants toward the center of the station, adjusting to the disjointed agrav fields. Pirates of all shapes and ages eye you for weakness; they're bedecked in prizes, modified combat armor plated with gold and gems, stolen high-end vacsuits, knotted neck-scarves, ostentatious luxury wear.

Above all is the hissing, thrumming figure of Warlord Jorien Kanta, more machine now than human. Her face is a mask. What skin you can see is space-cured leather.
The maybe-doctor, Cydonia, lurks near the base of her throne. He steps forward, "Behold!" he shrieks, "The court of Warlord Kanta, queen by blood-conquest, is in session!"

He gives you a wretched look. "Tell me you didn't."

"I am pleased to say that I have been in contact with our mutual friend," Horus says with a wink. "As with all good things, it will take time to enjoy the fruits of this effort."
"It seems I was right to trust you. Perhaps we shall have future dealings? Ah, and did I mention that despite the eroded morals of our youth, the Yaribay name is proving its academic prowess in this latest generation? Well, let me tell you..."
You manage to extricate yourself fairly quickly from hearing too many tales of the Yaribay offspring's latest success at the Galatia Academy.

[Line 8094] [Option Selected: "I can see why he's the man who leads the Persean League."]
"His ability, and the success that follows from great ability, are not difficult to perceive," he says.
"Gens Hannan PR sees to that, of course," Horus adds with an ironic smile. "Every victory of the League is Reynard's; every setback, another's mistake... which he is gracious enough to forgive, of course, in public."

[Line 8095] [Option Selected: "He's an insufferable egotist."]
"True though that may be, his accomplishments are notable and do much to justify much," he pauses on the word, "of his presumption."

"Gens Hannan is powerful," he says, "and Reynard a man who knows well how to wield power."
"I respect his station and ability, though he and I agree on few matters of politics."

[Line 8097] [Option Selected: "How can you let that man run the League like it's his own fiefdom?"]

[Line 8103] "$PlayerSirOrMadam," your comms officer calls your attention. "Port authority is... they were acting strangely. Contact's mood shifted after the $shipOrFleet was identified."
Comms look up from their console. "I think we've been quietly flagged by the authorities for some reason."

[Line 8104] The $FactionLong port authority refuses your request for docking clearance after your $shipOrFleet transmits its identity credentials.
The refusal is rather perfunctory, and your comms officer relays that it appears as though traffic control is following orders given by Menes Yaribay to bar you, personally, from visiting Olinadu. Turning off your transponder to prevent identification might yield better results.

[Line 8131] The secretary nods attentively, hands unmoving. Accessing some kind of implant?
"Wonderful. I'll let the Prime Demarchon know as soon as he's available."

[Line 8132] The secretary nods attentively, again.
"Fantastic. I'll inform the Prime Demarchon as soon as he's free."

[Line 8133] Ever pleasant and responsive, the secretary nods with that hint of a smile.
"Of course, thank you $playerSirOrMadam. I'm sure the Prime Demarchon will contact you as soon as he's able."

"The League has an obligation to protect all free peoples of the Persean Sector, captain." Reynard speaks with the bland moral superiority of a consummate politician. "It is our very purpose to secure universal freedom."
Then, he allows that persona fall away.
"Of course you don't believe that, do you."

[Line 8137] [Options Given: RHannan_whyHarassingReact1a:"Of course not, I'm no fool. What's your game, Hannan?"

[Line 8138] [Option Selected: "Of course not, I'm no fool. What's your game, Hannan?"]
"We might just be able to work together, captain." He smiles indulgently, then adds softly "And yet I do believe. If I tell you only one truth, it is that I do believe."

[Line 8139] [Option Selected: "I would rather like to believe that the ideals of the League meant something."]
"You and I both, captain," he says coldly. "It is simply your convenience to judge to unpracticed ideals from the outside."
"The League, captain, is everything! It is everything to me, to Gens Hannan. Our excellence blossoms within the freedom of the League. I have earned the fruit and I have built them to towering heights - look upon proud Kazeron. No mere backwater, it is a barycenter of power!" 
Reynard pauses, looking away for a moment. "What have you built, captain? Do not speak to me of ideals; show me."

"My freedom," he hits the table with two fingers, "I have given it for my world and for my Gens; look upon proud Kazeron! I have earned everything you see before you. The League gave me that freedom, and the League has prospered for it!"
Reynard pauses, taking a breath and allowing a brittle calm to re-settle. "Do not speak of ideals. Show me."

Reynard puts a finger to his lips, his face tilting downward in thought for a moment. "I'm afraid I don't recall any messages," he says with an appropriately generous air of apology... tempered by the merest hint of dismissal.
"What did you wish to discuss?"

[Line 8148] [Options Given: RHannan_msgDoYouEven:"Do you even read your messages?"]

[Line 8156] [Option Selected: "Do you even read your messages?"]
"Captain." Reynard gives you a pitying look.
His message is clear: You should know better than to ask. And in asking, you've wasted both his time and your own.
But more importantly, his.

[Line 8157] [Option Selected: "I inquired about joining the Persean League."]
"Did you," he says rather than asks, making it clear that he did not receive any message. And if he did, he wouldn't have troubled to remember it.

[Line 8158] [Option Selected: "I said I would offer my services to Gens Hannan."]
"If you are looking for a job, then I suggest you go find a spacer bar and 'ask around'."
He dances his fingers at these last words, like he's discussing something far, far beneath his interest.

[Line 8159] [Option Selected: "I have important information to discuss concerning the future of the Persean Sector itself!"]
"I-" he begins, then manages to just suppress a yawn.
"You must forgive me, captain. The League Council sessions can run late." He resettles himself, adjusting his overcoat back into carelessly perfect disarray.
"Pardon my forgetfulness, did you have a matter of pressing concern to discuss?"

[Line 8160] [Option Selected: "This information is very important, it concerns the Gate system and the Galatia Academy." (explain)]
Reynard begins to yawn loudly again, interrupting your explanation.
He halts suddenly in the middle of the act - for it is an act - to give you an impatient look.
"As I've explained, captain," that lowly title used as reprimand, "I don't wish to discuss such matters with you."

[Line 8161] [Option Selected: "I wish to discuss... a delicate matter involving Horus Yaribay's activities."]

RHannan_msgFollowHorusYaribayC:"It's more complex than that."]

"I am touched by your concern, captain," Reynard says with too-practiced warmth. "But trust that I have a handle on the intrigues of my good friend Horus."

[Line 8163] [Option Selected: "Um. No?"]
"I am touched by your concern, captain," Reynard says, as if indulging a bright student. "But you may trust that I have a handle on the intrigues of my good friend Horus."

[Line 8164] [Option Selected: "It's more complex than that."]
"I'm sure it is," Reynard says easily, as if indulging a bright student. "Which is why I have several intelligence networks keeping an eye on the intrigues of my good friend Horus."

[Line 8165] He spreads his hands, ever-generous of spirit. "You need not give me his cryptokey or anything so gauche. It would hurt Horus to be so betrayed."

His eyes narrow.
"What'd you get into? You didn't agree to anything she offered, did you?"

"You did, didn't you." He glares. Then makes an exasperated sigh.

[Line 8187] [Option Selected: "Not... exactly."]
He glares at you for a moment. Then sighs, looking away.

[Line 8188] [Option Selected: "I found a dead ship. Full of recordings of hatred for this Glamor-Rotanev."]
"Of course!" Arroyo says with a laugh. "Oh, that's our Zunya alright."
He takes a deep breath and rubs his forehead, suddenly somber. "Let me tell you about her."

[Line 8189] [Option Selected: "She told me you didn't have the 'killer instinct for senior leadership'."]
"She would," he says.
"What I know is that business is about people. Business is deals, and people make deals. I'm a people person. That's why I'm looking out for you, $playerFirstName. Remember that."
Then makes an exasperated sigh.
"Now. Glamor-Rotanev," he frowns and puts his hands together.

He glares at you for a moment. Then sighs, exasperated.

[Line 8191] [Option Selected: "You know what? Never mind."]
"No, you can't just back out of this," he says with a glare. "You need to know who you're dealing with."
He pauses for moment, considering you.
Then sighs, exasperated.

[Line 8192] [Option Selected: Continue]
"What she believes is that if she makes a show of how much she doesn't care about anything, anyone, it'll look like she's the most ruthless and focused executive in the Company. Just see how much she's willing to destroy to succeed! There must be something to it, right?"
He sits back, fists clenched. "It's a waste of capital! Human resources, too. Do you know how expensive it is to train good techs, competent management? Of course loyalty can be bought, but then her performance gets attached to the Company brand and makes buying it more expensive for the rest of us. So now I'm paying higher labor premiums? To boost HER career?"

[Line 8193] [Options Given: arroyo_askAboutZGR3c:"So her plan was to get those mercs killed?"]

"My advice is, if you get involved? Watch your back. Mind yourself. Don't trust her."
He looks away, thinking. His hands held together in front of his mouth, not quite the form of Luddic prayer.
"Seen a few fleet operators fall right off the map. She's looking for something. Big risk. I'd bet if I knew what it was I'd say it wasn't worth it."

His eyes meet yours through the link.
"We won't. I'm going to be rich, get richer, and enjoy my splendid home. You can go do something very stupid if you have to. Just hope it doesn't get us all killed."

[Line 8204] His eyes meet yours through the link.
"I'm going to be rich, get richer, and enjoy my splendid home. You should do the same."
He looks away again, presumably at achingly beautiful mountain vistas. "But you won't."

He leans back in his chair.
"Sure."

"Sure."

[Line 8210] Replace us all with AI cores - hah! Do that, and they'll zip off into their own hole in hyperspace and make 11-dimensional art or some Ludd-damned thing or other. The smarter those things are, the more unreliable they get. No mind for business, take my word for it."

[Line 8211] He gives you a look.
"Don't get clever, inspector." He speaks the word with ironic emphasis. "My legal team is more than happy to let you know or anyone else just how hypothetical my statements are."

[Line 8225] [Option Selected: "I understand you've been funding Cornelius Elek. Giving him ideas."]
The Director's face creates a smile. "He wasn't supposed to tell anyone. But this is Cornelius Elek, so I cannot be surprised."
Her face, and tone, go blank again.
"You have something more to say about Elek. Proceed."

[Line 8225] [Options Given: ZGR_postGADHOimply1:"He was looking into an old sensor array. It found the Onslaught Mk.I."]

[Line 8226] [Option Selected: "He was looking into an old sensor array. It found the Onslaught Mk.I."]

[Line 8226] [Options Given: ZGR_postGADHOimply2:"Yes. I thought you might be involved."]

[Line 8227] [Option Selected: "Yes. I thought you might be involved."]
"What made you think that, I wonder," she says.

[Line 8227] [Options Given: ZGR_postGADHOimply3:"Because you're Tri-Tachyon's Director of 'Special Acquisitions'."]

[Line 8228] [Option Selected: "Because you're Tri-Tachyon's Director of 'Special Acquisitions'."]
Glamor-Rotanev creates a smile for you.
"Yes, I was admiring your new acquisition." Her eyes flicker oddly, and you detect what might be a rare spark of genuine amusement. 
"Or perhaps I should call it your very, very old acquisition."

[Line 8229] [Option Selected: "Because you're Tri-Tachyon's Director of 'Special Acquisitions'."]
Glamor-Rotanev creates a smile for you.
"And you found it." She sounds unsurprised by the news. "Elek was distraught, I am to understand."
Her eyes flicker oddly, and you detect what might be a rare spark of genuine amusement.

[Line 8230] [Option Selected: "Because you're Tri-Tachyon's Director of 'Special Acquisitions'."]
Glamor-Rotanev creates a smile for you.

Her eyes flicker oddly, and you detect what might be a rare spark of genuine amusement.

[Line 8231] [Option Selected: "Academician Elek. You funded his research. And directed it."]
Glamor-Rotanev creates a smile for you.
"I am a patron of the sciences. Didn't you hear?"

[Line 8232] [Options Given: ZGR_postGADHOelekPrefer:"Elek prefers his science abstract and very far away, I think."]

[Line 8233] [Options Given: ZGR_postGADHOelekHowKnow:"You prompted him. How did you know what that sensor array found?"]

[Line 8236] [Options Given: ZGR_postGADHOout:"Let's talk about something else."]

[Line 8237] [Option Selected: "Elek prefers his science abstract and very far away, I think."]
She nods slowly, once.
"It will take some time, and credits, for him to become a useful asset again. It is much as any investment."

[Line 8237] [Options Given: ZGR_postGADHOelekPrefer2a:"So was the payoff worth the investment?"
ZGR_postGADHOelekPrefer2b:"That's a cold way to put it. He's a human being, even if he's.. him."]

[Line 8238] [Option Selected: "So was the payoff worth the investment?"]
"I cannot answer, as that investment has not fully matured," she says. "Which brings me to business."

[Line 8239] [Option Selected: "That's a cold way to put it. He's a human being, even if he's.. him."]
"Your impulse to moralize is irrelevant to my interests," she says. "Let us return to business."

[Line 8240] Option(s) Selected: ['ZGR_postGADHOelekPrefer2a']
Her eyes fix upon you through the link. "And that business is the Onslaught Mk.I, which you found."

[Line 8241] [Option Selected: "You prompted him. How did you know what that sensor array found?"]
"Old records," she says curtly.
"The Galatia Academy doesn't know what it has, much less how to make good use of it. Their lack of self-motivation is self-evident."

[Line 8242] "Then this topic serves no more purpose," she says frostily.
"Anything else?"

[Line 8243] "I am satisfied, $playerName."
It's not that her tone is warm, more that it lacks a certain otherwise ubiquitous contempt perceivable only now by its absence. 
Presumably temporary, of course.

[Line 8244] [Option Selected: "Let's talk about something else."]
She makes no response.

zgr_omkiScanOfferReduxLater:"Let's discuss this later."]

She leans back ever so slightly, but makes no outward response.

ZGR return after encountering Threat and/or Dweller and/or OMKI

[Line 8255] Your comms are routed through a secretary, either a holosim or product of uncanny cosmetic and behavior tuning, then, after a brief wait, the link blinks to Director Glamor-Rotanev.
"Captain $playerLastName," she says, then pauses. "You found something, didn't you."

[Line 8256] The comms flick into an active feed nearly instantly.
"Captain," Director Glamor-Rotanev greets you, simply. "I was just admiring your new acquisition."
Her eyes flicker oddly, and you detect what might be a rare spark of genuine amusement. 
"Or perhaps it is better described as your very, very old acquisition."

[Line 8257] [Options Given: zgr_postWeirdOptProceed:"I found... many things. And an Onslaught Mk.I."
zgr_postWeirdNothingLie:"Nope, nothing yet." (lie)]

[Line 8263] [Option Selected: "I believe I've found what you're looking for."]
"Excellent."
To your shock, her smile is nearly human. The mask is replaced almost instantly, though a slackening echo of the expression remains on her lips.
"I, and my researchers, are most eager to examine your findings. And you to be paid, no doubt.

[Line 8264] [Option Selected: "I believe I've found what you're looking for."]
"It pleases me to hear that." She doesn't smile.
"I, and my researchers, are most eager to examine your findings. And you to be paid, no doubt.

[Line 8265] [Option Selected: "I found something... hostile. In the Abyss."]
"Something." She raises an eyebrow.
"It was not human or AI-derived." This doesn't sound like a question.

[Line 8266] [Option Selected: "Nope, nothing yet." (lie)]
Her eyes, previously distant, stare at you through the link for a several seconds before she replies.
"I am eager to reward you for your work." Her tone is not inviting. "CEO Sun is in full agreement. There are extraordinary discoveries and profits to be made. I am uninterested in an obstinate parody of negotiation."

"Don't act this obstinate pretense of negotiation. You $shipOrFleet has been scanned. And we knew what you found well before you arrived anyway." She pauses quite consciously.
"I am... most eager to reward your work."
Despite her words, the tone is icy. "CEO Sun is in full agreement. We may share in extraordinary discoveries and profits."

"Tell me what you found."

"Oh?" Her eyes give a disconcerting twitch. "I should like to examine your discoveries."

Then creates the approximation of a smile.
"Great things shall be made, captain. You will see."

Her eyes are inhumanly still.
"We shall want more. You must bring more."

A rare smile flits on the Director's lips.

"Our results have already proven to be most stimulating."

"Breathtaking," the Director of Special Acquisitions says softly.

She says nothing, but her eyebrow raises fractionally. It is not an invitation to continue.
Nonetheless.

[Line 8304] [Options Given: zgr_askQuestionsThreatDo:"What are you going to do with the 'Threat' artifacts?"]

[Line 8305] [Options Given: zgr_askQuestionsThreatAI:"Does exploitating this technology not risk another AI War?"]

[Line 8306] [Options Given: zgr_askQuestionsThreatAre:"Do you know what the 'Threat' are, or where they came from?"]

[Line 8308] [Options Given: zgr_askQuestionsMonsterDo:"The 'other' specimens- what do you intend to do with them?"]

[Line 8309] [Options Given: zgr_askQuestionsMonsterAre:"Do you know what these 'other' specimens... are?"]

[Line 8310] [Options Given: zgr_askQuestionsHubDone:"That's all I wanted to ask."]

[Line 8311] [Options Given: zgr_askQuestionsHubDone:"Actually, never mind."]

[Line 8312] [Option Selected: "Actually, never mind."]
"Good," she says.

[Line 8313] "You've asked quite enough for today," she says. "Captain."

[Line 8314] [Option Selected: "What are you going to do with the 'Threat' artifacts?"]
"Research and development," she says. Her expression isn't quite a smirk.
"These components are obviously derived from a neglected branch of Domain-era technology. This makes them fundamentally human technology. The path to profitable exploitation is fundamentally open, albeit complex. The Tri-Tachyon corporation is ideally placed to exploit them."

[Line 8315] [Option Selected: "Do you know what the 'Threat' are, or where they came from?"]
"In the simplest terms," her voice contains more than a hint of condescension, "they are autonomous self-fabricating, self-modifying constructs derived from ancient Domain designs. Their intent, so far as they could be said to have intent, is destructive toward our technological base."
"'Why' is a more difficult question."
Her dead eyes move oddly. "I find it amusing that the Luddics would recoil in horror, but they could not find a better ally to their cause."

[Line 8316] [Option Selected: "Does exploitating this technology not risk another AI War?"]
"These are not artificial intelligences," she says decisively.
"Not that such distinction is necessary to Hegemony regulators. Whatever future war the Hegemony initiates, whatever new oppressions they conceive, it will be a consequence of leadership as paranoid as their masses are ignorant."
"Besides," she says, self-satisfied, "if I am right about everything, there will be no need for a war."

[Line 8317] [Option Selected: "So the 'Threat' are not alive, not intelligent?"]
"Is a machine alive? Is a virus?" She pauses for a fraction of a second before providing her own answer.
"I don't care."

[Line 8317] [Options Given: zgr_askQuestionsThreatAlive2:Continue]

[Line 8318] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Functionally the 'Threat' phenomenon demonstrates no attempt to present a sense of selfhood, collective or otherwise. What passes for communication is hostile and garbled; the loose ends of automatic warnings and obsolete Domain decrees. If it is conscious in any form, it is impossibly solipsistic."
"Which is just as well," the Director produces a robotic half-smile. "It will be a better tool that way."

[Line 8319] [Option Selected: "The 'other' specimens- what do you intend to do with them?"]
"Research and development." 
The Director releases a deliberate breath.
"We know it isn't human. We know it is powerful. The return on investment, therefore, is beyond human imagination."
She looks satisfied with the thought.

[Line 8320] [Option Selected: "Do you know what these 'other' specimens... are?"]
"That is speculation for the research division. Or perhaps you would care to ask a philosopher? Or a curate?" This last idea appears to amuse her, insofar as she is capable of expressing that, or any, emotion.
"My interest is in what these specimens, these phenomena, can DO. For me. Or the Company."
She pulls her glassy eyes back to the comm-link. 
"For humanity. At least that small percentage of it willing to accept the radical and necessary future."

[Line 8323] The link settles on feed of volatiles futures scrolling across the crest of the Tri-Tachyon corporation for just a moment before the comm-link connects you with a perfectly coiffed junior secretary.
"The Tri-Tachyon Corporation welcomes you to Eochu Bres. Their smile is uncannily bright. May we presume you wish to accept Director Glamor-Rotanev's invitation?"

"Fantastic." The face maintains an uncanny smile. "The Director is most eager to meet you."
An apologetic - but not guilty - expression forms. "Unfortunately, the automated defenses of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation have flagged your ID as a hostile and your shuttle would be gunned down upon approach. Please contact customer service to resolve this misunderstanding."
"We hope you have a pleasant and profitable day."
The smile re-appears.

[Line 8328] [Option Selected: Take a shuttle to visit Director of Special Acquisitions Glamor-Rotanev]
Your shuttle descends into the young atmosphere of Eochu Bres, through towering battlements of clouds. A spray of rain darkens your viewport for a moment before it is wiped clean by the heat and speed of your descent.
The flight path immediately deviates from the general approach corridor which had started ticking off minor use-fees from the Tri-Tachyon owned flight control: general volume access fee, priority flight lane fee, service fee, customer satisfaction insurance charge, advertisement bypass fee.
The notifications self-delete, their fees automatically refunded, as the towering central arcologies of Xanadu emerge from the mist.

Jagged mountain peaks ring the horizon. Gleaming monoliths glitter, spears of capital upthrust through the glowering flesh of the world. Skyarco II grows before you, prismatic.
Your shuttle alights on a landing pad held at some distance from the facade by an airy support rib. It looks impossibly thin, but on touch down feels as solid as a coherent M-type asteroid.

[Line 8331] [Option Selected: Follow]
The architecture of Skyarco II's interior and its integrated art-installations are titanic in scale and inhuman in affect. Your attention is subtly drawn toward geometric motifs suggestive of a mathematical intricacy which would reward close study with nothing less than delight, and...
"It was designed by an Artificial Intelligence," the cheerful secretary behind the reception desk informs you, breaking the trance. "Before the ban imposed by the Hegemony, of course." 
"The piece is explicitly referent-free to reflect the pure universe of interstellar markets which invite every new partner to participate in Tri-Tachyon's enterprise!"

A plane of glass - diamond-matrix, naturally - stretches in both directions to the edge of your peripheral vision, its extent blocked only by a set of cyclopean interior columns. Misty mountains and towering arcologies wreathed in rain clouds hang in the vista beyond.
Before you, a figure sits - now stands - behind a monolithic desk stark as a planetoid scraped bare by pulsar beam.
The Director of "Special Acquisitions".
A hand raises, open, to invite you to sit. A seat appears.

"Captain $playerName. I offer vast wealth in exchange for your unique facility in navigating exceptional scenarios."
She blinks once. Her gaze is fixed on you, but you can't help but feel it is slightly vague, apparently attentive but not present in spirit. The look of a cyber-aug.
Her tech must be absolutely top-of-the-line, of course.

"Risk of annihilation," she answers placidly. "For which you'll be appropriately compensated."

She gives you a curt look, but no comment.

[Line 8353] "You're proving useful to Provost Baird - an admirable figure generally - yet one who stubbornly ties herself to the Hegemony bureaucracy."
"If it weren't for Kallichore's blundering..." Her eyes grow distant - more distant - for a moment, then return to their usual unblinking detachment.
"Here at Tri-Tachyon, we put the highest value in unrestrained R&D. Especially its dividends." She smiles coyly. "So, I think, do you."

[Line 8354] "You've proven useful to Provost Baird. And your accomplishment with the Gates..."
She puts her hands together, not quite a single clap for all you've done. Her politely mechanical smile contains some bitterness, you sense.
"I admire Baird, truly I do. Her ability to overcome Hegemony stone-walling, and herding those academics with their notions... sadly, though, it appears as though her grip was too tight. Pity to lose top talent."
The bitterness, you see, has left Glamor-Rotanev's smile to be replaced with something more carnivorous.

If her look could become any colder without freezing the local atmo, it would.

[Line 8431] [Option Selected: "You know a lot about what I've been doing."]
"Crews talk, TriPads listen. There is little I cannot know if I so wish," she says, injecting a tone of boredom into her words.
"Accept it. Now let's speak of business."

[Line 8432] [Option Selected: "You've been prompting Elek. How'd you know where to make him look?"]
"Old records," she says curtly.
"The Galatia Academy doesn't know what it has, much less how to make good use of it. Their lack of self-motivation is self-evident."

[Line 8433] [Option Selected: "...You want to buy the Onslaught Mk.I from me?"]
She laughs with a buzz like a malfunctioning agrav plate.
"Oh, no. That'd be far too provocative to..." She gives a little flick of the hand, indicating enemies too irrelevant to bother acknowledging in speech.
The Hegemony, maybe.
"However," she fixes upon you. "I would gladly pay for the opportunity to have my people take a close look at it. And take a few samples, very small, nothing damaging."

[Line 8433] [Options Given: zgr_makePitch9OMKIbuy2:"You can't detect them, can you. That's what you want."]

[Line 8434] [Option Selected: "You can't detect them, can you. That's what you want."]
She blinks. "Detect them?"
Her voice is emotionless.

[Line 8434] [Options Given: zgr_makePitch9OMKIbuy3:"The Threat. They're all but invisible to you."]

[Line 8435] [Option Selected: "The Threat. They're all but invisible to you."]
Her face arranges itself into a shape suggesting dismissive amusement.
"What an interesting theory, captain. Whatever my motives, will you agree to my proposal? A simple look, a few scans. A few samples."

[Line 8435] [Options Given: zgr_makePitch9OMKIbuy4mil:"One million credits."
zgr_makePitch9OMKIbuy4later:"Let's discuss this later."]

[Line 8436] [Option Selected: "One million credits."]
A long pause. Her eyes flicker, accessing. Calculating.
"This is possible." She speaks with an emotion suddenly present - quiet displeasure, presumably at your maneuvering.
"You ask for much, captain."

[Line 8436] [Options Given: zgr_makePitch9OMKIbuy4mil2:"Tri-Tachyon's Director of Special Acquisitions can afford a mere million credits. I accept."

[Line 8438] [Option Selected: "Tri-Tachyon's Director of Special Acquisitions can afford a mere million credits. I accept."]
"Done," she says, her voice as empty as the Abyss.
Almost instantly, your TriPad pings with several alerts - credits transfer, but also notification from your tactical officer concerning an approaching Tri-Tachyon portside-tender, swarming with engineering drones, and your comms, forwarding certain docking requests directly to the Onslaught Mk.I.
"Take a moment to ensure your affairs are in order, captain," Glamor-Rotanev says.
You'd think she enjoys overwhelming your officers with the speed of her response.

[Line 8438] [Options Given: zgr_makePitch9OMKIscan0:Make the arrangements]

[Line 8439] [Option Selected: "Let's discuss this later."]
"Fine," she says, the spite cold in her voice.
"You've seen them. The Threat. Ancient, automated warfleets deep in the Abyss. And you lived." She is quite collected, suddenly, as she speaks.
"Would you part with recordings of your encounter with the Threat? I offer 100,000 credits for immediate transfer."

[Line 8439] [Options Given: zgr_makePitch9threat2:"I accept."
zgr_makePitch9No:"Perhaps another time."]

[Line 8440] [Option Selected: Make the arrangements]
Director Glamor-Rotanev takes a moment to turn and appear to look out over her spectacular view of the Xanadu Geodivision.
You're certain she's watching her teams as they board the Onslaught Mk.I through what are no doubt top-of-the-line cybernetic implants and neural integrations.
And, doubtless, watching your comms. Because just as you are finished, she turns back, resettling her facial muscles with a twitch.

[Line 8441] [Options Given: zgr_makePitch11:"So there was another expedition before me?"]

[Line 8442] [Option Selected: Continue]
Her eyes flicker subtly, her expression more glazed and vacant than before.
"Very... good, captain," she says. Her words come more rapidly. "You've seen them. The Threat. Ancient, automated warfleets deep in the Abyss. And you lived."
"Would you part with recordings of your encounter with the Threat? I offer 100,000 credits for immediate transfer."

She says nothing, her disapproval resounding in the silence.

[Line 8445] [Option Selected: "But what IS it?"]
"A threat, presumably. The hostile connotation lives in the name." A quick, bloodless smile. "You'll prepare yourself for anything, I'm sure."

[Line 8446] [Option Selected: "How will I know when I find it?"]
"We assume it'll engage in some sort of hostile action against you or your $shipOrFleet," she says indifferently. "Only this won't be pirate, Pather, or tariff patrol."
"Nor," she fixes you with a cool look, "Some remnant AI warfleet. Those, those we know about."
"Disappointing conversationalists," she mutters. "Superintelligence with no mind for business. Simply unbelievable..."

[Line 8447] [Option Selected: "I've seen ancient warfleets deep in the abyss. And... non-material hostile entities."]
She blinks. Her eyes seem suddenly present for the first time. And she stares for several seconds, motionless.
"You're telling the truth," she says, outwardly cool.
"Would you part with recordings of your encounters with both of these... forces? I offer 150,000 credits for immediate transfer."

You expect the Director will shed no tears if you and your crew perish. But she has a reputation for rewarding success and effective, if shadowy, investment and development.

"I don't know why I still talk to you," $heOrShe muses. "You've made a very expensive enemy in Tri-Tachyon again and again. And now you return, begging forgiveness? It will take a fortune in bribes. You understand this, don't you?"

"You've been an outrage! It's going to be very expensive! Deal with the consequences!"

"So," $heOrShe looks grim. "We're really doing this." $HeOrShe looks away, up at nothing. 
"You should have bought a planet to go live on for the rest of your life. It'd probably be cheaper. And I wouldn't have to pull some strings that I'd rather avoid."
$HisOrHer gaze returns to the holo-feed. "But here we are. Now I'm going to go spend a fortune to make people tolerate you. Don't screw it up."

"Credits are not enough," $heOrShe admits, then locks you with a fierce look.

Sindrian Diktat characters
------------------------------
[Line 8535] After an interminable wait watching Sindrian Diktat propaganda montages, the comm-link connects you with a stiff-looking junior officer in the uniform of the Lion's Guard, Andrada's personal ideologically-disciplined military order.
"Victory to the Lion of Sindria!" $heOrShe greets you with alarming enthusiasm. "How shall you serve the Supreme Executor's vision?" 
You feel somewhat put on the spot by this demand.

$Rank $PersonName's face tightens a little, somehow.
"You do not simply speak with," $heOrShe takes on a corrective tone, "the Supreme Executor, the Lion of Sindria, Admiral Philip Andrada."
A pause for breath, then $heOrShe continues, "And I would warn you to show proper deference to the greatness of the man."

[Line 8542] [Option Selected: "I wish to petition the glorious Supreme Executor Admiral Andrada."]
$Rank $PersonName nods, just a little.
"As you surely realize, the Lion of Sindria receives countless petitions from his loyal followers. I shall log your request."

[Line 8543] [Option Selected: "Aren't you supposed to ask how you can help me?"]
You notice a small eye-twitch.
"The office of the Supreme Executor does not provide handouts. It is the strong who find themselves drawn to the glorious vision of Supreme Executor Admiral Philip Andrada, and who, through his Movement, shall return civilization to the Persean Sector and then the former Domain." 
$HeOrShe looks up, you presume at a portrait of Andrada. "It is only, ONLY through service to his unique and glorious vision for a new humanity that excellence may be achieved."
$HisOrHer gaze lowers toward you, now. "The only question you must answer is: how do you fit into that vision?" $HisOrHer eyes narrow, "Or will you find yourself among the dregs of history?"

[Line 8544] [Option Selected: "I don't know. Tell me how I serve the glory of the Lion's vision."]
$Rank $PersonName nods dutifully, and something similar to but distinct from pleasure crosses $hisOrHer face.
"Submission to Supreme Executor Admiral Philip Andrada's glorious new vision for the future is the first step. Let me send you some literature..."

$HeOrShe leans in, "Personally, I like to read a few lines before sleep and upon waking. I find it focuses my mind and aligns my will with the necessity of the Movement.
Returning to $hisOrHer former posture, $heOrShe continues, "Serve the interests of the Sindrian Diktat. You may be so lucky that a place for you may be found in our Movement - find an administrator and they may assist you in taking on a commission in service of the Supreme Executor."

[Line 8567] [Option Selected: Continue]
With a series of bangs, troopers in light combat frames burst through every entrance, shouting amplified orders, waving vicious little guns. 
Random INTSEC raid; you know enough to appear calm and keep your hands away from your sidearm.
Each patron is scanned and, in-turn, their fate is revealed by a subtle movement of the lead INTSEC officer signaling whether they are to be left alone or arrested. Most are spared.

[Line 8567] [Options Given: sdbr_raid2:Keep cool]

[Line 8568] [Option Selected: Keep cool]
One group of spacers appears to believe they have something to hide. As the officer approaches, they break into action. One manages to half-draw a concealed weapon but is hit with the crack of an electrostun/restraint-foam round. The convulsing body crashes through a table, sending pieces of broken glass up in glittering parabolae.
The rest of the party are restrained and beaten, the drumming of clubs on flesh eventually overtaking the cries of pain and outrage. Outsiders look on in horror; the staff and locals have a glazed, unfocused expression; it is safest to see nothing.

You find yourself slumped against a rattling air vent in a minor offshoot of the commercial concourse. One of your guards, bleeding and appallingly bruised, applies a dermal patch to your neck and your consciousness acknowledges the ocean of pain receding like a tide, leaving a loose hollowness in your chest and numbing cold in your limbs.
INTSEC simply wanted to send a message, it appears. Nothing more, nothing less.

The INTSEC officer gives a small nod to the guards, then moves on with arbitrary authority to the next spacer captain, who is given a similar treatment.

"Yes, yes," Ram leans in, an odd gleam to his eyes now apparent. 
"You see clearly that Philip Andrada's vision has been corrupted from the glorious early days. The ministries have fallen to infighting and corruption; our fleets are bloated with incompetents, our factories run by degenerate plunderers. The martial virtues which defined our once-glorious Diktat have been lost - we must reclaim them."
"The Supreme Executor is not himself, and may already be dead. We see holos, but who can say if they are true? Corrupt advisors are exploiting the situation for their own benefit, so it is up to us - the front-line officers loyal to the Movement, who know blood and sweat - to save the Diktat!"

"I am not merely a uniform. I follow orders, yes, but I have been watching the way of things for a long time. I have been speaking with like-minded officers loyal to the Andradan Movement, who know the blood and sweat of our struggle."
Ram leans in, an odd gleam to his eyes now apparent. "It is obvious that the Sindrian Diktat has fallen to rot. Do you imagine Andrada is truly in command? With the ministries fallen to self-serving infighting? He would never allow it. Things have changed since the old days. He would sooner die than let his vision come to this... this degeneracy!

"You see, I was merely acting my part in the grand tower of authority necessary to maintain order. If it were not me in the uniform that day, it would have been another." Ram leans in, an odd gleam to his eyes now apparent. "Don't you see? It is bigger than me or you. Hold your animal instinct in check, and listen."
"The Sindrian Diktat is drifting, leaderless. Do you imagine Andrada is really in command? With the ministries fallen to infighting and self-serving corruption? He would never allow it. He would sooner die than let his vision come to this! Something must be done!"

"It has become a hateful thing, hasn't it? It is nothing like the early days, when strong men pure of spirit knew what needed to be done. The course of state has strayed! It is obvious that Supreme Executor Andrada is no longer at the helm, that he no longer truly leads us. It is tragic, isn't it? A great man reduced to this by declining health and bad advisors. It is obvious but unsaid that the ministries have fallen to in-fighting and self-serving corruption."

He wants to set up some kind of secret meeting. It is unclear whether his actions are legal within the Diktat, and unclear what power-play between competing ministries this might represent.

[Line 8641] [Options Given: sdtu_prepWeaponSword:The sword of an officer, like you used on Eventide]

[Line 8642] [Option Selected: A clutch of small plastic grenades]
Your armorer walks you through the process of activating as well as deactivating the grenades, and familiarizes you with their timing and throw-weight. You conceal a half-dozen of them about your uniform.
The infernal little things pack a devilish punch.

[Line 8643] [Option Selected: A matte-black polycarbonate pistol]
Your armorer ensures the pistol is unloaded, then hands it and two cellmags to you. It's a little shadow of a thing, and darker still, the armorer explains, on most personal scanners.
You load the pistol, ensure its status is green and safety is locked, then conceal it on your person. It weighs barely anything, but can punch a fist-sized hole through flesh without breaching standard bulkheads.

[Line 8644] [Option Selected: A vicious ceramic vibroknife]
Your armorer demonstrates activating the knife; the blade blurs slightly and you hear the keening of a small insect at the edge of your hearing. This knife, when active, could slice a new opening into your shuttle.
Your armorer deactivates it, then expertly flips the knife around to offer you the handle. You conceal it on your person. 

[Line 8645] [Option Selected: A tiny capsule of spray-poison]
Your armorer affixes the sprays inside your uniform cuffs - they would pass for subtle fabric-stiffening clips - and, with safeties on, demonstrates the motion required to activate the spray.
With a mere flick of the hand and a demon's exhalation you could ensure the rapid loss of consciousness or death of a small cluster of adult humans within a range of a few meters. The poisons would then react with self-contained nanotech pseudo-proteins to dissolve into a wisp of molecules which could be plausibly found on any imperfectly maintained spacefaring vessel.

[Line 8646] [Option Selected: The monomolecular wire]
"Ah," your armorer can't help but smile, "A classic."
They affix the false-fingertip to your hand, allowing it a moment to match the color and texture of your finger, then demonstrate how to unspool the weighted tip into a deadly filament which you can use like an molecule-width cutting garrote, or swing in a severing arc.

[Line 8647] [Option Selected: No weapon; you don't need one]
Your ops chief lifts an eyebrow but manages to hide their smile. Your armorer merely nods compliance, then begins securing the miniature arsenal.

[Line 8648] [Option Selected: The sword of an officer, like you used on Eventide]
Your armorer lifts an eyebrow then gives a quiet order via hand-comms. Within the minute, a crewmember brings your sword, handing it off to your armorer who then offers the flat to you using two hands, as is correct.
You secure the scabbard to your belt in the style of the conservative elements of the Hegemony officer corps. The weight of hand-forged steel is reassuring.

[Line 8649] [Option Selected: Equip a secret holorecorder rig]
Your technology officer proudly offers you a small case.
The holorec unit is a whisper of transmitter wire visible only when it catches the light, fine as a hair, and a couple small dermal patches to be placed around your face and head. Even without the passive-camo system active, it is difficult to see the individual components of the rec unit without knowing what to look for.

[Line 8650] [Option Selected: Bring a squad of marines as backup]
You order a half-dozen of your most experienced marines to don stealth-op gear.
Their outer suits shimmer and rustle, and six sleek black marines in light armor transform before you into a group of civilian technicians wearing vague impressions of vac-safety gear and overalls.
You have to but whisper the code-phrase and they will perform a rapid assault - through airlock and bulkhead if necessary - to secure your position.

[Line 8651] [Option Selected: Board the shuttle and fly to Ram's Safehouse]
With a flash of the Sindrian Diktat's crest, the shuttle receives navigation instructions from orbital traffic control. The whorls of storms and rivers of clouds hang before you, over the shining Volturnian sea. Closer, you begin to make out the lights of floating habitats, sprawling farm envelopes, and transient mining platforms.

[Line 8651] [Options Given: sdtu_ramSafehouse1:Continue]

[Line 8652] [Option Selected: Continue]
The shuttle hits atmo with a barely perceptible change in the craft's harmonics.
As the surface grows closer, the glittering lights and reflections of artificial structures resolve into a sprinkling of garbage; plumes of smoke from processing plants, oil-slicks from extraction platforms, a spew of jetsam trailing from the overcrowded habs.
The current regime has allowed the industrial conglomerates to self-regulate provided they are politically reliable.

[Line 8652] [Options Given: sdtu_ramSafehouse2:Continue]

[Line 8653] [Option Selected: Continue]
Ram's safehouse is in a logistics and warehousing complex attached to the spur of one such industrial cluster.
The air is thick with the sweet stench of petrochem.

[Line 8653] [Options Given: sdtu_ramSafehouse3:Step inside the safehouse]

[Line 8654] Your disguised marine squad fans out, passing plausibly  for workers on a shift-break snacking on nutrition bars and igniting narcosticks.

[Line 8655] A quick glance at your datapad shows your perspective in perfect miniature; the holorec unit is working perfectly. 

[Line 8656] [Option Selected: Step inside the safehouse]
A plainclothes INTSEC goon - obvious from their demeanor - opens the door, looks you over disapprovingly, and relieves you of your holstered sidearm before leading you down metal stairs to a dark inner room below the street level.
Yannick Ram sits at a cheap conference table, dismissing the goon with a wave. The door thuds shut behind you, its weight suggesting armor or shielding.
"Captain, captain. I am so pleased that you have joined me. We have much to discuss, much to do," Ram stands with a chilly smile.

[Line 8656] [Options Given: sdtu_ramSafehouse4:Continue]

[Line 8657] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Simply put, the plan - and my fellow patriots are in agreement - is to test and provoke the leaders of the Sindrian Diktat's three arms of power. They will either prove their loyalty to the vision of the Supreme Executor, Lion of Sindria, Philip Andrada, or they will show themselves to be corrupt cowards and traitors who must be executed to ensure the purity of the Great Cause."
"First, the navy. While the Grand Star Marshal is nominally in charge, he lies half-conscious in a clinic on Sindria. The Supreme Executor should have replaced him a cycle ago, but," Ram pauses significantly, "has not."
"In his place, Deputy Star Marshal Oxana Hyder commands the Askonia System Defense Armada. She is... unimaginative, and I suspect she regrets leaving the Hegemony behind during the Battle of Salus."

[Line 8665] [Options Given: sdtu_ramMarines:Call in the marine squad]

[Line 8667] [Option Selected: See if you can find a makeshift weapon while he's distracted]
Your eyes dart around, looking for something useful. The table itself is light metal and plastic, as are the folding chairs. Their mass is insufficient for a bludgeon.
The lighting is provided by a few rapidly degrading peel-off glowstrips; useless. In the shadows of the room your eyes catch on some liquid storage barrels - water? - and  a few hand-cargo containers. Padded, with rounded corners for zero-G safety.
Ram has a sidearm on his belt. It would take him but a moment to draw it. Or if he came closer to you...

[Line 8668] [Option Selected: Let him talk; make sure the holorec is getting everything]
With Ram distracted by pacing and ranting, you take a peek at your datapad. The holorec rig reads all-green, but the signal seems to be rapidly degrading. There must be some kind of interference- an automated counter-signal unit in the safehouse? 
Will Ram be alerted if you keep transmitting?

[Line 8668] [Options Given: sdtu_ramSafehouseHolorecOn:Keep transmitting; more blackmail material means more leverage
sdtu_ramSafehouseHolorecOff:Turn off transmission; record to hard memory to not set off an alert]

[Line 8673] [Option Selected: Prepare your weapon while he's distracted with himself;['sdtu_ramSafehouse4prepWeapon']]
With a light touch you feel the comforting mass of your weapon of choice. Ram sees nothing, distracted by his own monologue.

[Line 8674] You slip one of the grenades into your hand and hold it in place with your thumb.

[Line 8675] You slip the tiny pistol out of its hiding place by pretending to stretch your shoulders. You have it in your lap now, covered by your crossed hand.

[Line 8676] You slip the vibroknife out of its hiding place by pretending to stretch. Now it is hidden in the cuff of your uniform, read to draw and activate.

[Line 8677] You pull the cuffs of your uniform straighter, ensuring the deadly spray will hit your intended target, and flex your wrist in anticipation of deployment.

[Line 8678] You rub your hands together, twisting the false fingertip just so. It is ready to deploy the deadly monomolecular wire with a flick of your hand.

[Line 8679] You brush the leg of your uniform as if clearing it of imagined dust, loosing the protective clasp that keeps the sword from drifting out of its scabbard. You tense your muscles, ready to draw steel in a single motion.

[Line 8681] [Options Given: sdtu_ramSafehouse6:Continue]

[Line 8682] [Option Selected: Call in the marine squad]
You whisper the codeword under your breath as Ram rants.
Nothing. You tap your earpiece, making as if you are scratching your ear, and it gives the tiny buzz denoting signal disconnection.
There must be some kind of active interference. This secure comms rig is outrageously overrated for even moderately fortified military defenses. Ram must be running a highly sophisticated automated counter-signal unit. Would it alert him to your attempt at comms?
His disposition, though agitated, seems unchanged.

[Line 8682] [Options Given: sdtu_ramMarinesA:Continue]

[Line 8685] [Option Selected: Continue;['sdtu_ramMarinesA']]
"Next, Guard High Deputy Executor Horacio Caden. By the decree of Diktat, he holds the second-in-command rank to the Supreme Executor, and leads the Lion's Guard which is sworn to protect the person of Philip Andrada and the integrity of his political and spiritual vision."
Ram clenches his jaw; anger now showing through. "Caden has clearly failed. He is a dogmatic simpleton, repeating the words of the Lion without feeling them, knowing them! They do not BURN in his heart as they do in ours!" 
Captain Ram is almost shouting toward the ceiling. Perhaps addressing Caden and the other misguided followers of the Sindrian Diktat.

[Line 8686] [Option Selected: Continue]
There's a muffled thump.
Ram's goon dropping something? But the weight of the door suggests it would take a great deal more force to make a sound which could be heard in this room.
"... Which brings me to Chief High Inspector-General Dolos Macario," Ram continues, almost spitting, "Head of the internal security services of which I am of course a part. Never was there a more..." 
Ram pauses in his tirade, lifting a hand to his ear. He turns to you with a confused look.

[Line 8687] [Option Selected: Continue]
The door flies open in a flash, the thud of a shockwave buffets you back a half-step, ears ringing.
Blurred shadows burst in, targeting lasers flickering, firearms covering you and Ram. Through the settling cloud of dust steps a man in a long black coat over a perfect black uniform.
Ram gapes, hands raised; now, mercifully, at a loss for words.

[Line 8687] [Options Given: sdtu_ramSafehouse8:Continue]

The pistol in the man's hand barks once.
Yannick Ram falls to the ground, dead.

[Line 8689] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Captain $playerName," says Dolos Macario, head of the Sindrian Diktat internal security ministry, in-person.
The Spider of Sindria, they call him, who lurks in the Lion's shadow and strings up his enemies, extracts their secrets, and makes them suffer before they are 'disappeared'.
Macario's weapon is aimed at you, now. 
"What an awkward first meeting." He glances down, then looks back up, smiling like a corpse. "My humblest apologies."

Macario looks at you reasonably, "In that we are agreed."

[Line 8694] [Option Selected: "He was mine to kill. For justice."]
"Justice?" Macario raises his eyebrows, "How interesting."

[Line 8695] [Option Selected: "He was mine to kill. For revenge."]
"Then it seems that I owe you a death," Macario says, nodding reasonably. "That I can provide."

[Line 8698] "But first," he dips his pistol once toward the floor. "Would you be so good?"
As you hesitate, he says "The grenades. All of them. Six, I believe."

[Line 8699] "But first," he dips his pistol once toward the floor. "Would you be so good?"
As you hesitate, he says "Your clever little pistol. Drop it."

[Line 8700] "But first," he dips his pistol once toward the floor. "Would you be so good?"
As you hesitate, he says, enunciating sharply, "The knife."

[Line 8701] "But first," he dips his pistol once toward the floor. "Would you be so good?"
As you hesitate, he says "The spray capsules in your cuffs. All of them. Keep them pointed toward the ground."

[Line 8702] "But first," he dips his pistol once toward the floor. "Would you be so good?"
As you hesitate, he says "The monomolecular wire. I admire your verve, but let us be civilized about this."

[Line 8703] "But first," he dips his pistol once toward your scabbard, "Your clasp is loose."
As you hesitate, he says "The sword of an officer must be kept secure, yes? Mustn't have an accident, nor draw such a blade in haste."

[Line 8704] "I would expect you would know this, considering your misadventure on Eventide," he says with mock-concern. "But let us not open old wounds."

[Line 8705] "We need not repeat your little adventure on Eventide here, yes? You will find that we have a much more modern attitudes in Askonia." 

[Line 8706] Macario's eyes flick to lead yours to Ram's corpse on the floor. The blood is pooling.

[Line 8707] The squad's targeting lasers hold steady on you.

Macario sighs expressively, pistol steady on your center of mass. "Your squad is detained. Some of them, anyway. Now, shall we have a civilized discussion?"

[Line 8716] Option(s) Selected: ['sdtu_ramSafehouse10a'];['sdtu_ramSafehouse10b'];['sdtu_ramSafehouse10c']
He holsters his pistol and, stepping over Ram's cooling body, draws a chair from the table. "Let us sit for a moment. All this excitement... I would very much like to have a chat with you."

You stand. Macario ignores this, giving his soldiers a dismissive little wave. You expect that they'll be at the ready nearby.

[Line 8719] "Captain Ram was a traitor and has met the end which all traitors deserve," Macario leans back in the cheap folding chair, looking thoughtful. 
"I am embarrassed to admit that he was also - in the broad strokes - correct in his assessment of current state of our dear Sindrian Diktat. And his plan is a reasonable one."
"I have decided to enact it, with your cooperation."

[Line 8733] [Options Given: sdtu_macIntroCourseTrue:"Of course. I live to serve the Sindrian Diktat."]

[Line 8734] [Option Selected: "Doesn't this conspiracy make you the traitor?"]
"Of course not," Macario says, almost annoyed at the idea.
"Authority flows from power," he explains. "After I secure the future of the Diktat, the only traitors will be those who oppose me."

[Line 8735] [Option Selected: "What plan? That unhinged ranting?"]
Macario smiles thinly.
"The plan is simple enough. In light of the Supreme Executor's upcoming... transition, we must root out treason and corruption at the highest level - by which I mean, of course, those arms of the state which project violent force: the navy, in the person of Oxana Hyder, and the Lion's Guard, in the person of Horacio Caden."
"I, of course, see to the reliability of my own ministry," his eyes flick to indicate Ram's corpse.
"Once the means of force are purged of traitors, they shall burn out the rot that has taken root in this Great Project: the so-called Volturnian resistance and the double-blight of Nortia and Umbra in rebellion. Once our power-base in Askonia is consolidated, the Diktat may turn its gaze outward."

[Line 8736] [Option Selected: "What do you mean by 'turn its gaze outward'?"]
"You didn't get to your position without knowing the meaning of ambition, captain." Macario pins you with ice-cold eyes, "You of all people know full well that ambitions will be attacked on all sides by lesser men, whether from brutish ignorance or degenerate ideologies."
"The Sector is in turmoil. Imagine if its might and resources were focused by the vision of a man with... ambition."

[Line 8737] [Option Selected: "Does Andrada know about this plan?"]
"That question is no longer relevant," Macario's look hardens. "The question now is of who is prepared to carry on in his name."
You can only conclude that there is a power vacuum in the space Andrada should be. There's been no public announcement of death or illness, but the Sindrian Diktat keeps very tight control on its information sphere - and never shows signs of weakness.

[Line 8738] [Option Selected: "Are you a man with... ambition?"]
Macario, unblinking, looks just a little bit delighted at your question.
"Someone must be. Philip knew this, in his time."

[Line 8739] [Option Selected: "What's in it for me?"]
"Influence, credits, advanced spacecraft hulls, experimental weapons..."
Macario spreads his hands wide, a river of generosity, then takes a moment to whisper into his cuff.
"That is a taste to ensure that I have your attention for the remainder of our conversation."
Within seconds, your personal comms ping a surprised response from your quartermaster.

[Line 8740] [Option Selected: "The answer is 'no'."]
"Do my ears deceive, dear captain?" Macario says with mock disappointment.
"I beg of you, let us finish our nice conversation. Then we may think things over, mm?"

[Line 8741] [Option Selected: "Of course. I live to serve the Sindrian Diktat." (lie)]
"Liar," Macario says gleefully. "And utterly perfect! You demonstrate precisely the bold duplicity I require."

[Line 8742] [Option Selected: "Of course. I live to serve the Sindrian Diktat."]
"Fascinating," Macario says, perhaps to himself. "But would you die to serve the Diktat? No, no, don't speak. It is far too personal a question."
"Besides," he adds, "I require that you live. Which is why you do." He makes a ghastly smile.

[Line 8743] [Option Selected: "Why would I ever want to help you?"]
"An interesting question, captain."

[Line 8744] "As the bearer of a commission of the Sindrian Diktat, you are already pledged to the grand vision of the Supreme Executor!"
"Hyder and Caden are more apt to trust you," Macario says, his tongue flicking around his teeth, "-and believe you; that they share whatever motives sleep in their hearts. Which we will discover."

[Line 8745] "You are viewed as a friend of the Sindrian Diktat, particularly among those of any consequence: the officers, the officials, and of course the party."
"Hyder and Caden are more apt to trust you," Macario says, his tongue flicking around his teeth, "-and believe you; that they share whatever motives sleep in their hearts. Which we will discover."

[Line 8746] "You are considered suspect among those of consequence in the Sindrian Diktat; the officers, the bureaucrats, the party members."
"As an outsider, a provocateur, you are expected to hold outrageous political opinions which provides you with credibility to those of traitorous intent."

[Line 8747] "You are hated among those of consequence in the Sindrian Diktat! You are to be shot on sight. Why, I should turn you in myself," Macario grins with genuine humor.
"But don't you see? As an outsider, a comrade of terrorists and traitors, you are my perfect friend: you will be trusted by internal enemies with traitorous intent."

[Line 8748] "It was your work with the Galatia Academy, for Provost Baird, that first drew my interest." Macario seems delighted to tell you about this.
"Baird found in you an excellent..." he hesitates, searching for a different word, "-partner. An excellent and capable partner working toward great things for the Sector."
"Ah, that I might pry Baird's secrets away from the Hegemony," he adds quietly. "One day, one day."

[Line 8749] "You are a rising independent power. Such shifts, even small, have a way of upsetting the balance kept so carefully these past cycles."
"Do you understand how you instill fear into strategic planners? Your motives are... erratic. You could do anything. It's perfect."

[Line 8750] "It was your appearance of devotion to that quaint religion that drew my attention. You, of all people, becoming a pilgrim?"
Macario nearly giggles at the thought. "It's a splendid ruse. So absurd that I could not even believe it until I had it confirmed. No one will suspect you! They'll think you're a mush-headed Luddic out to balance the scales on your imagined soul!"

[Line 8751] "It was your appearance of devotion to that quaint religion that drew my attention. You, of all people, a mere Luddic?"
Macario nearly giggles at the thought. "It's a splendid ruse. Simply splendid, captain. So absurd that I could not even believe it until I had it confirmed. No one will suspect you! They'll think you're a mush-headed Luddic out to balance the scales on your imagined soul!"

[Line 8752] "Why, it is because you work for the enemy, the Hegemony!"
"The Diktat has always been a knife to their throat. Small, yes, but with a keen edge, a ruthlessness that the best of the officer corps could recognize, and those too craven to commit to Philip's vision look upon with jealousy. The children of Eventide wish they could dispense with the cloying ideology of the Domain and exercise a power truer and purer."
"And among us, there are now cowards who cringe from heroic destiny. You will sniff them out because you look like the possibility of defection." 

[Line 8753] "The answer is sheer power. You have an impressive independent fleet and no tremendously strong connection to any significant faction."
"Do you understand how that makes strategic planners fearful? Your motives are... erratic. You could do anything. It's perfect."

[Line 8754] [Option Selected: "I get it. What do you want done? Hypothetically."]
"You begin to understand," says Macario. "Good."
"I shall provide you with a file. It concerns an officer under Deputy Star Marshal Hyder's command who she has ordered to meet with a smuggler to purchase armaments. This is, of course, treason."
"Hyder believes she must circumvent the bureaucracy to maintain the condition of the Defense Armada. She is correct; the Lion's Guard takes the lion's share," he makes a strange, suppressed noise at his own joke, "-of the military procurement budget. This provides us an opening; leverage."

"Find out her intentions; if she is willing to engage in open treason, or if pushed, will she side with myself: the legitimate authority in the upcoming struggle. Her rivalry with Caden and the Lion's Guard is well known, so that may be a good axis upon which to turn her."

[Line 8762] [Options Given: sdtu_macHyderNoWant:"I don't want to do this."]

[Line 8763] [Option Selected: "Why don't I just talk to her?"]
"You're welcome to try," Macario says smugly. "Without an opening, however, you will get nothing. I know how she works." 

[Line 8764] [Option Selected: "Why don't you just talk to her about all of this?"]
Macario looses a breathy laugh.
"A fine and obvious suggestion, dear captain, but she hates me. That stubborn old woman won't have her mind changed by me, much less open her heart."

[Line 8765] [Option Selected: "I don't want to do this."]
Macario produces a rictus of a smile.
"Play your part, captain. You will find the rewards incalculable."

[Line 8766] [Option Selected: "If she is engaging in treason, technically, why not eliminate her now?"]
"And throw the Sindrian Diktat into civil war? With her in command of the System Defense Armada?" Macario rolls his eyes, "Listen to yourself."
"Timing," he hisses, "The time must be correct."

[Line 8767] [Option Selected: "How would killing her subordinate possibly make Hyder trust me?"]
"You don't know her like I do, captain. She is a capable admiral, a brilliant logistician, and a dreadful politician. She loathes contradiction, inefficiency, and above all lies. When she must participate in such squalid affairs, she will be put off-balance and seek stability. Provide it."
Macario looks pleased with himself. "It is trivial to manipulate her. I trust, with my help, you are capable of it."

[Line 8768] [Option Selected: "I'll... see what I can do."]
"Ah," Macario raises a finger. "Just one thing, captain."
"You've been very, very bad," he wags his finger, scolding you. "I'll arrange matters to allow you to operate in Diktat space. But you must promise to behave. You'll behave?" 
He doesn't wait for an answer, "Good."

[Line 8768] [Options Given: sdtu_safehouseEnd:Continue]

[Line 8769] [Option Selected: Continue]
Stepping back onto what passes for a street, you look up at one of the ubiquitous flickering holos of Philip Andrada, Supreme Executor of the Sindrian Diktat. You try to imagine the Lion of Sindria drooling and mindless, deep in some bunker-clinic, surrounded by increasingly panicked doctors.
Macario seems like a man who turns his capable subordinates into tools and his ambitious subordinates into corpses. But if you play along, for now, he readily provides generous rewards - and access to the heart of the Sindrian Diktat's upcoming power struggle.

[Line 8770] An idle thought prompts you to check the holorec's memory. It's been remote hacked; your feed has been replaced by an old Andrada propaganda experience. Macario's little joke, you suppose.


------------------------------
SDTU step 3: Arrest patrol leader
------------------------------
[Line 8773] This fleet is transmitting the transponder code provided by Macario. It is commanded by the 'traitor' you must arrest or kill.

[Line 8774] [Options Given: sdtu_traitorPatrolUnderArrest1:"You are under arrest by order of Chief High Inspector Dolos Macario."]

[Line 8775] [Options Given: sdtu_traitorPatrolSoldOut1:"Bad news. You've been sold out by Dolos Macario."]

[Line 8776] [Options Given: sdtu_traitorPatrolUnderArrest1b:"I'm here - again - to arrest order from Chief High Inspector Dolos Macario."]

[Line 8777] "You." $HisOrHer eyes narrow, already suspicious.
"I would not expect to see you again after making such outrageous and, dare I say, illegal claims. I could order your arrest already on suspicion of terrorist activities."

[Line 8778] This time $heOrShe is ready.
"You return! I hereby declare you a criminal and traitor for the crimes of falsifying official documents, threatening an officer, and attempting to undermine the authority of the Supreme Executor."
"A death in space is better than you deserve, terrorist scum." $HeOrShe looks over $hisOrHer should and gives a wave. The comms cut out and the opposing fleet maneuvers to an attack posture.

[Line 8778] [Options Given: sdtu_patrolAgainDidWarrantOpen2:Cut the comm link]

[Line 8780] [Option Selected: "You are under arrest by order of Chief High Inspector Dolos Macario."]
"Absurd!" $HeOrShe shouts, annoyed. "I should have you arrested for claiming false authority and making a mockery of the Sindrian Diktat!"

[Line 8781] [Option Selected: "Bad news. You've been sold out by Dolos Macario."]
You watch the blood drain from $hisOrHer face. $HeOrShe knows that $heOrShe might have a very big problem.
"What is the meaning of this? You speak outrageous mockery and claim false authority! I should have you arrested for that alone."

[Line 8782] [Options Given: sdtu_traitorPatrolWarrantReaction:Transmit the arrest warrant provided by Macario]

[Line 8783] [Options Given: sdtu_patrolAskSurrender:"Do the right thing and surrender yourself without a fight."]

[Line 8784] [Options Given: sdtu_patrolDemandSurrender:"Surrender now, or I will attack."]

[Line 8785] [Options Given: sdtu_patrolConvinceMutiny:Convince $hisOrHer crew to turn $himOrHer over without a fight]

[Line 8786] [Options Given: sdtu_patrolForAPrice:"I can help you out of this... for a price."]

[Line 8787] [Options Given: cutCommLink:"Oops, wrong comms-ID. I need to go now."]

[Line 8788] [Option Selected: Transmit the arrest warrant provided by Macario]
Now you see true fear fall across $hisOrHer face. Macario's reputation doing its work.
"This... this could be faked. It must be a fake," the Diktat $rank's eyes dart around, looking for some escape. "Why would he send you?" 

[Line 8790] [Option Selected: "Surrender now, or I will attack.";['sdtu_patrolAskSurrender']]
A series of emotions flood across $hisOrHer face. Despair, betrayal, sadness. Anger, then rage.
"No," $heOrShe growls, then cuts the comms. 
The opposing fleet assumes an aggressive posture.

[Line 8791] [Option Selected: "Surrender now, or I will attack.";['sdtu_patrolAskSurrender']]
$HeOrShe laughs cruelly. "You would make such a demand, from that puny $shipOrFleet?"
"It is I who will see your fleet burn! I hereby declare you a criminal and traitor for the crimes of falsifying official documents, threatening an officer, and attempting to undermine the authority of the Supreme Executor."
"A death in space is better than you deserve, terrorist scum." $HeOrShe looks over $hisOrHer should and gives a wave. The comms cut out and the opposing fleet maneuvers to an attack posture.

[Line 8793] [Option Selected: "I can help you out of this... for a price."]
$PersonRank $PersonName hears out your offer, and reluctantly agrees. Better a life on the run than a death in one of Macario's INTSEC torture sites.
In short order, a credits transfer comes in, and an officer-class escape pod is launched from the opposing flagship toward your $shipOrFleet.
Your comms officer interrupts as you oversee the 'rescue' operation.
"Captain. We have incoming priority comms from the Sindrian Diktat fleet."

[Line 8793] [Options Given: sdtu_patrolForAPrice2:Open the comm-link]

[Line 8794] [Option Selected: Open the comm-link]
Just what you needed, another Diktat officer.
"Rogue fleet," the upjumped lieutenant barks - a poor sign for your chances of coming to an understanding.
"You have picked up the escape pod of a traitor who has abandoned their post, an act of treason against the will of the Supreme Executor. Surrender the traitor now or prepare to be boarded!"
Your tactical officer pings you, alerting you to the fact that the Diktat patrol's disposition appears to be in disarray.

[Line 8794] [Options Given: sdtu_patrolForAPrice3b:"It is you who is the traitor, and I have documents to prove it!"
sdtu_patrolForAPrice3c:"Lieutenant, is it? You're welcome for the promotion."
sdtu_patrolForAPrice3d:Cut the comm link.]

[Line 8795] [Option Selected: "It is you who is the traitor, and I have documents to prove it!"]
The comm link is cut from the other end. It seems like they're not in the mood to talk.

[Line 8796] [Option Selected: "Lieutenant, is it? You're welcome for the promotion."]
The comm link is cut from the other end. It seems like they're not in the mood to talk.

[Line 8797] [Option Selected: Cut the comm link.;['sdtu_patrolForAPrice3b'];['sdtu_patrolForAPrice3c']]
The former CO of the Sindrian Diktat fleet seems to have jumped ship without unlocking executive override. It'll take them a while to reassert control; Andrada learned from his own lessons when it came to mutinies.
Disengaging would be trivial.
After all, if this reaction is anything to go by, you're going to have a pressing engagement with Deputy Star Marshal Hyder.

[Line 8797] [Options Given: sdtu_patrolLeave:"Nav, get us out of here."]

[Line 8798] [Option Selected: Convince $hisOrHer crew to turn $himOrHer over without a fight]
You have your comms officer transmit your appeal on all channels: $PersonRank $PersonName is a traitor in the eyes of the Supreme Executor as per the warrant provided to you by his Chief High Inspector, Dolos Macario. 
Anyone who assists this arrest will be doing their duty to the Sindrian Diktat. Anyone who interferes will be branded a traitor and abettor of terrorism to be dealt with as INTSEC sees fit.
With each word, you can watch $PersonRank $PersonName on a muted comm feed growing more enraged - and more unsure. In perfect silence, you see $himOrHer looking around wildly, shouting words you cannot hear, then arms from out-of-scene grab $himOrHer.
The comm-feed cuts out for a moment.

[Line 8798] [Options Given: sdtu_patrolConvinceMutiny2:Continue]

[Line 8799] [Option Selected: Continue]
"This is the second-in-command now assuming control of this fleet in light of the previous commander's treason," they almost manage to hide their smirk at the usurpation of their superior officer.
"We shall now transfer the traitor to your authority to return to INTSEC for questioning, trial, and execution. Glory to the Lion of Sindria! Death to traitors!"
They salute.

[Line 8799] [Options Given: sdtu_patrolConvinceMutiny3:"I'm sure loyalty won't go unnoticed, lieutenant."
sdtu_patrolConvinceMutiny3a:"Uh, death to traitors to you, too."]

[Line 8801] [Option Selected: "I'm sure loyalty won't go unnoticed, lieutenant."]
The second-in-command is good to their word, and their former commanding officer is handed over to you, not in chains, but held by a set of thick plastic restraints, stripped of uniform insignia, and dulled by sedatives.
You have them secured in the brig.
Now to have a difficult conversation with Deputy Star Marshal Hyder.

[Line 8801] [Options Given: sdtu_patrolLeave:"Nav, get us out of here."]

[Line 8803] Your sensors officer reports an officer-class escape pod floating in a spray of debris. A quick jaunt by a salvage crew confirms that the escape pod holds Macario's "traitor". You order them secured in the brig.
There is also an intact cargo pod containing an advanced weapon system - part of the shipment being smuggled under Hyder's orders.

SDTU step 3.5: release patrol leader on independent world
------------------------------
[Line 8806] [Options Given: 20:sdtu_releaseOfficer:Release the Sindrian Diktat officer you promised to help escape]

[Line 8807] [Option Selected: Release the Sindrian Diktat officer you promised to help escape]
The former Sindrian Diktat fleet commander looks miserable and unsteady in a borrowed jumpsuit. They mumble some words of thanks and disappear into the human jetsam of the Persean Sector.
Whether they end up dead by the hand of a Diktat reprisal-assassin, crewing a pirate vessel, or joined up with some odd sect of Luddics, you have fulfilled a promise.


------------------------------
SDTU step 4: Meet Hyder's fleet
------------------------------
[Line 8811] Oxana Hyder appears on the comms, already seething.

[Line 8812] "You have kidnapped an officer of the Sindrian Diktat, an officer under my command. I offer you this one chance to stand down and surrender honorably before your fleet is destroyed."

[Line 8813] "You attacked a flotilla of the Sindrian Diktat navy and kidnapped the commanding officer - an officer acting under my direct orders. I offer you this one chance to stand down and surrender honorably before your fleet is destroyed."

[Line 8814] "How far the Hegemony has fallen, if the Auxiliary has come to this," she adds under her breath.

[Line 8815] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderOfficerSmuggling:"That fleet was smuggling weapons. Macario calls it treason."]

[Line 8816] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderOfficerSmuggling:"That officer was smuggling weapons. Macario calls it 'treason'."]

[Line 8817] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderOfficerScheme:"The truth is that this is Macario's scheme to test your loyalty."]

[Line 8818] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderOfficerShot:"If it helps, it was Macario's idea. At least after he shot the man who thought it up first."]

[Line 8819] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderOfficerForAPrice:"If it helps, they abandoned their command to flee Macario."]

[Line 8820] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderOfficerMutiny:"The crew mutinied and handed the officer over without a fight."]

[Line 8821] [Option Selected: "That officer was smuggling weapons. Macario calls it 'treason'."]
"Following orders," Hyder grits her teeth, "even secret orders, from the highest authority of the navy to ensure the effective operation of military assets is not treason." Disgust fully enters her voice now, "No matter how Macario tries to twist the truth."
"Half of the so-called 'intelligence operations' performed under his authority could well be called treason, but I don't make it my business to meddle as he does."

[Line 8822] [Option Selected: "The truth is that this is Macario's scheme to test your loyalty."]
Hyder looks at you for a moment, her opinion perhaps shifting.
"I appreciate your honesty. It is more than I would expect from one of Macario's creatures."

[Line 8823] [Option Selected: "The truth is that this is Macario's scheme to test your loyalty."]
Hyder looks at you for a moment, her opinion perhaps shifting.
"I appreciate your honesty. It is the least I would expect from a bearer of a Hegemony commission. I can't say I understand why you are playing at being one of Macario's creatures."

[Line 8824] [Option Selected: "If it helps, it was Macario's idea. At least after he shot the man who thought it up first."]
She frowns. Then, instead of denying your claim, says "Typical of Macario. He mistakes cruelty for discipline and fear for obedience. He's a sad prototype of the Diktat's 'new man'."
Hyder looks at you for a moment, her opinion perhaps shifting. It's easy to see that she hates Macario, and easy to re-align her anger away from yourself.
"You are correct to conduct yourself honestly, despite the appearance of the circumstances," she says.

[Line 8825] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk1DontApprove:"So you don't approve of Macario's methods."
sdtu_hyderTalk1WordsAsTreason:"He might interpret your own words as treason."
sdtu_hyderTalk1GoalsNotMethods:"I approve of his goals, if not his methods."]

[Line 8826] "He conducts himself without a shred of honor while wrapped in the banner of the Supreme Executor. He twists the words of Philip Andrada to serve his own degenerate desires." She pauses, seething.

[Line 8827] [Option Selected: "So you don't approve of Macario's methods."]
"He conducts himself without a shred of honor while wrapped in the banner of the Supreme Executor. He twists the words of Philip Andrada to serve his own degenerate desires." She pauses, seething.

[Line 8828] [Option Selected: "He might interpret your own words as treason."]
"He would in an instant," she spits, "if it served his next degenerate scheme."

[Line 8829] [Option Selected: "I approve of his goals, if not his methods."]
"Then I would demand you re-evaluate your perception of his goals," Hyder says haughtily.

[Line 8830] Option(s) Selected: ['sdtu_hyderTalk1ServeHeg'];['sdtu_hyderTalk1DontApprove'];['sdtu_hyderTalk1WordsAsTreason'];['sdtu_hyderTalk1GoalsNotMethods']
She continues, "Macario says what is useful to himself. Observe the results of his actions: paranoia, inefficiency, and lawlessness." 

[Line 8830] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalkRound2startLaw:Continue]

[Line 8831] [Option Selected: "If it helps, they abandoned their command to flee Macario."]
"A commander should never abandon their command," Hyder states this like cold fact. "Never."
"Dereliction of duty is treason enough. Better to face Macario's machinations with an honorable death than let his lies and subterfuge corrupt our sacred duty." 

[Line 8832] [Option Selected: "The crew mutinied and handed the officer over without a fight."]
"A crew's duty is to follow the orders of a superior officer. That officer assumes moral responsibility for failure. Disobedience requires court-martial for the grave crime of mutiny."
"It is better to face Macario's machinations with an honorable death than allow his subterfuge to corrupt sacred duty." 

[Line 8833] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk1JustJob:"Look, I just did the job. Your laws and your ethics are your business."]

[Line 8834] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk1Harsh:"That seems harsh. It is Macario who manufactured the dilemma."]

[Line 8835] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk1Unacceptable:"You're right, a true officer would stand by their position, even unto death."]

[Line 8836] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk1UnacceptableLie:"You're right, a true officer would stand by their position, even unto death." (lie)]

[Line 8837] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk1HarshCrew:"The crew merely intended to uphold the law; it is Macario who manufactured the dilemma."]

[Line 8838] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk1Unacceptable:"You're right. Mutiny is absolutely unacceptable in a warfleet."]

[Line 8839] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk1UnacceptableLie:"You're right. Mutiny is absolutely unacceptable in a warfleet." (lie)]

[Line 8840] [Option Selected: "Look, I just did the job. Your laws and your ethics are your business."]
Her eyes narrow. "They are. And seeing as you are presently within the legal and ethical volume of the Sindrian Diktat, you must respect our laws."

[Line 8841] [Option Selected: "That seems harsh. It is Macario who manufactured the dilemma."]
"He did," she admits, and without hesitation continues: "Nonetheless, my officer failed their mission and their position. An officer who delivers defeat to their commander must face that fact honorably, not discard their uniform and duty to flee like a coward. To that point."

[Line 8842] [Option Selected: "The crew merely intended to uphold the law; it is Macario who manufactured the dilemma."]
"Your command-instinct to look to the wellbeing of the crew is admirable," she concedes.
Then her eyes narrow, "But beware over-indulgence in mercy; it will make you weak. As Andrada said, 'A true leader understands that victory is bought with casualties'."
"So: if the greatest good is to uphold the law, then this crew shall serve that cause by providing an example of its execution."

[Line 8842] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalkRound2startLaw:Continue]

[Line 8845] "Then we stand together on this matter of honor," she says with a nod.

[Line 8854] [Option Selected: "I will transfer them to your custody immediately."]
"Good," Hyder says, then gives orders to a subordinate to begin the process of prisoner transfer.

[Line 8854] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3start:Continue]

[Line 8855] You had made a deal to set the officer free on the first independent world you visited. They will view you poorly for this breach of trust, but then, they are simply one rogue Sindrian Diktat officer with very few friends in the Persean Sector.
If it is any consolation, Hyder's court-martial is likely to be a less cruel fate than whatever Macario had in mind.

[Line 8856] [Option Selected: "Macario issued the arrest warrant. I will take the officer to him."]
"I see," Hyder says flatly.
"I offer this: your objection will be recorded, then you will transfer the prisoner. I shall assume responsibility for the question of jurisdiction. This will fulfill your obligation and leave the matter to the law of the Sindrian Diktat."

[Line 8856] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk2Transfer:"I accept. I'll have the prisoner sent to you immediately."

[Line 8860] Hyder looks thoughtful. "Then we find ourselves at an impasse, captain, with each sworn to uphold their highest duty and loyalty." 
A pause, then she continues, "Your conviction is undeniable, captain. Let us table the matter."
It sounds like she's going to let you get away with the prisoner, without admitting it. Interesting. Best play along.

[Line 8877] [Option Selected: "Macario issued the arrest warrant. I will take the officer to him."]
"So you are a creature of Macario," says Hyder, her anger suppressed neatly under an officious demeanor. "I will take this matter all the way to the office of the Supreme Executor, if I must."
She takes a deep breath.

[Line 8878] [Option Selected: "With apologies, Macario also told me to lie about this to gauge your reaction." (lie)]
Hyder closes her eyes and rubs the bridge of her nose; it seems that she does not enjoy the prospect of lie and counter-lie.
"Typical Macario," she says finally, her anger now - mostly - directed away from yourself. "No more games! Transfer the prisoner to my custody so that a proper court-martial may proceed."
She fixes you with her glare. "Do this by the proper order of things, each in its place. This is the way of the Sindrian Diktat."

[Line 8878] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk2Transfer:"I will transfer them to your custody immediately."
sdtu_hyderTalk2PrisonerToMacarioFinal:"Macario issued the arrest warrant. I will take the prisoner to him."]

[Line 8879] [Option Selected: "With apologies, Macario also told me to lie about this to gauge your reaction." (lie)]
Hyder closes her eyes and rubs the bridge of her nose; it seems that she does not enjoy the prospect of lie and counter-lie.
"Typical Macario," she says finally, her anger now - mostly - directed away from yourself.
"Tell Macario," she spits his name out like a rotten piece of food, "that my loyalty to the Supreme Executor is unquestionable. And that I shall be making a report of his waste of naval resources to my superior."

[Line 8879] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3start2:"There's just one more thing..."]

"Now then, I believe our business is concluded for the present," she says.
"Tell Macario," she spits his name out like a rotten piece of food, "that my loyalty to the Supreme Executor is unquestionable. And that I shall be making a report of his waste of naval resources to my superior."

[Line 8882] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3start2:"There's just one more thing..."]

[Line 8883] [Option Selected: "There's just one more thing..."]
She pauses as she reaches toward the comms shut-off. "What is it, captain."
Macario was right about one thing, at least: Hyder is not difficult to read.

[Line 8884] It feels like she trusts you. Or, at least, she respects the impression you have made so far and would like someone to trust.

[Line 8885] You've made a mixed impression; it feels like she doesn't quite trust you, but she is operating in a nest of vipers and wants to trust someone, somehow.

[Line 8886] She doesn't trust you. And she would like nothing more than to have an ally who she trusts and respects after operating alone in the regimented chaos of the Sindrian Diktat bureaucracy. You have only the briefest opening here.

[Line 8887] She doesn't trust you. She doesn't like you. She thinks you're working for Macario, or at least working to be on his level. At least your position is clear.

[Line 8888] "I have little patience for this," she says. "Choose your words carefully."

[Line 8889] "Enough," she says. "Make your report back to Macario. And consider your words carefully."
The comms cut.

[Line 8890] "I have little patience for this," she says. "Choose your words carefully."

[Line 8891] "Enough," she says. "Make your report back to Macario. And consider your words carefully."
The comms cut.

[Line 8892] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3Hegemony:"Would you return to the Hegemony? I could talk to someone..."]

[Line 8893] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3Leadership:"Who should lead the Sindrian Diktat when Andrada is dead? You?"]

[Line 8895] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3BossTalkAndrada:"And when is the last time you met with Andrada?"]

[Line 8898] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3Andrada:"With Philip Andrada as good as gone, what are you loyal to now?"]

[Line 8899] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3Boss:"Your superior is incapacitated in a clinic on Sindria, so... who do you report to?"]

[Line 8900] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3WhySmuggle:"Why does the Deputy Star Marshal of the Sindrian Diktat need to smuggle weapons?]

[Line 8902] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3Glory:"Glory to the Sindrian Diktat."]

[Line 8903] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3Bye:"Until we meet again."]

[Line 8904] [Option Selected: "Would you return to the Hegemony? I could talk to someone..."]
"Silence yourself!" she almost snarls. "Speak no more treason to me."

[Line 8905] [Option Selected: "Would you return to the Hegemony? I could talk to someone..."]
She looks at you for a long, long moment.
"I am, to them, a traitor. Do you know the justice a traitor-in-combat is served? Execution, by will of the commanding officer." She pauses, watching you. "There is good reason this is so."
Which, you note, is not really an answer to your question.

[Line 8906] "And you'll help him do it, I'm sure," she says acidly. "You test Fate's love for irony when you gloat for Macario before he's claimed victory."

[Line 8907] "And yet he has not," Hyder says fiercely. "If he could fuel starships and feed their crews with lies alone, he would. But he cannot."

[Line 8908] "And yet has not," Hyder says fiercely. "He knows that he can't run the navy on threats and lies."
"I give my officers and my crew something to believe. With me, they will find strength in honor, duty, and discipline. These are concepts Macario cannot comprehend, and despite his misallocation of resources, we are stronger than he can imagine. Philip Andrada knew this."

[Line 8909] [Option Selected: "Why does the Deputy Star Marshal of the Sindrian Diktat need to smuggle weapons?]
Hyder smoothly hits the privacy field switch, blinks, then faces you.

[Line 8910] [Option Selected: "Why does the Deputy Star Marshal of the Sindrian Diktat need to smuggle weapons?]
"The details of military arms procurement by the Sindrian Diktat navy is a matter of polity security," Hyder says with flat yet somehow seething affect. "It is not the business of an outsider. Or of meddlesome worms like Macario."

[Line 8911] [Option Selected: "Why does the Deputy Star Marshal of the Sindrian Diktat need to smuggle weapons?]
"Captain. Though not without some character befitting an officer, you are an outsider and cannot be expected to understand."
"The Diktat has enemies within and without; if it is fighting with itself, it will never survive. I must do what I must to maintain our strength even if I am put into," her lip curls, "an intolerable position." 

[Line 8912] [Option Selected: "Why does the Deputy Star Marshal of the Sindrian Diktat need to smuggle weapons?]
"Captain. I shall be forthright out of respect for a fellow officer."
"It is," her lip curls in a sneer, "Intolerable. I have not been given due authority, yet I have responsibility for the System Defense Armada."
"Macario, through Caden, seeks to starve my fleets and make me look incompetent. Philip Andrada would never have stood for it, if he was capable. If he wasn't beguiled by flatterers and liars. If he was the Philip Andrada I pledged myself to during the Battle of Salus!"

[Line 8913] [Option Selected: "Your superior is incapacitated in a clinic on Sindria, so... who do you report to?"]
Hyder smoothly hits the privacy field activation switch, blinks, then faces you.

[Line 8914] [Option Selected: "Your superior is incapacitated in a clinic on Sindria, so... who do you report to?"]
"Who told you that?" she demands, "Macario?"
Settling her composure, she continues. "Regardless, the Supreme Executor sits above the senior ministry-level officers of the Sindrian Diktat. I report to him, of course."

[Line 8915] [Option Selected: "Your superior is incapacitated in a clinic on Sindria, so... who do you report to?"]
"I expect Macario told you that," she says, eyes seemingly fixed on yours through the comms. "Testing my resolve from every angle."
She looks aside for a moment, "It is no wonder the so-called Resistance has lasted this long with the Chief High Inspector-General so committed to doing anything other than his duty." 
Settling her composure, she continues. "Regardless, the Supreme Executor sits above the Grand Star Marshal and all ministry-level offices of the Sindrian Diktat. I would report to him, of course."

[Line 8916] [Option Selected: "Your superior is incapacitated in a clinic on Sindria, so... who do you report to?"]
"I expect Macario told you that," she says, eyes fixed somewhere above the comms. "Testing my loyalty from every angle he can find, I'm sure."
"But it is a problem. To maintain proper hierarchy of authority, the Supreme Executor should have assigned me that rank and the accompanying powers. Then I would be able to simply dictate around the supply deficit Macario and Caden conspired to create."
Still looking elsewhere, "But then, under Andrada, they wouldn't have dared..."

[Line 8917] [Option Selected: "'Under Andrada.' So Andrada is incapacitated?"]
Her face twitches, eyes fixed intensely on you for a moment.

[Line 8918] [Option Selected: "Shouldn't you be Grand Star Marshal if the current one is incapacitated?"]
"Yes," she says empathically, with the weight of a stalled career and impossible position.

[Line 8919] [Option Selected: "Shouldn't you be Grand Star Marshal if the current one is incapacitated?"]
"That would be correct. Not, of course, to presume." She looks conflicted.
"It would be... it is the responsibility of the Supreme Executor himself to assign that rank and office."

[Line 8920] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3Andrada:"But he won't. Or can't."]

[Line 8921] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3BossTalkAndrada:"So why hasn't he? How long has it been?"]

[Line 8923] "A meeting of the high ministers could theoretically agree to invoke the Articles of Succession, but Macario wants to ensure that it is he who dictates the result of that meeting. And he'll drain the lifeblood of the Sindrian Diktat for as long as it takes." 

[Line 8924] [Option Selected: "So why hasn't he? How long has it been?"]
Her eyes fix on you. She doesn't like this question, not one bit.
"That is no business of yours."

[Line 8925] [Option Selected: "So why hasn't he? How long has it been?"]
Her eyes fix on you. She doesn't like the question.
"Too long," she says evenly.

[Line 8925] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3Andrada:"He is not well, is he."]

[Line 8926] [Option Selected: "He is not well, is he."]
The speed at which Hyder smashes the privacy field activation switch is impressive for a woman of her years.

[Line 8927] [Option Selected: "He is not well, is he."]
After a long moment, she sighs.
"Whatever Macario told you, whatever you believe and think you know, the future of the Sindrian Diktat... will be determined without your meddling."
She sounds more tired than ever before. 

[Line 8928] [Option Selected: "He is not well, is he."]
She looks suddenly more tired than ever before.
"If the Supreme Executor was dead, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Macario would like to line his pieces up just right. And you're as good as one of them."

[Line 8929] [Option Selected: "He is not well, is he."]
"So Macario told you that much," she says, and sighs, looking more tired than ever before. She seems to think something over, and comes to a decision.
"The Supreme Executor isn't dead," she says, "not yet." She almost breathes the next word, "barely."
"I fear when he dies we shall be thrown into the crisis manufactured by Macario. It could undo everything we fought for." She rubs her face with her hands, "Would that the good ones who followed Admiral Andrada all those years ago were not taken from us. Would that the worst did not rise to the top."

[Line 8930] [Option Selected: "Who should lead the Sindrian Diktat when Andrada is dead? You?"]
She lets out a cynical laugh.
"No, not me. I am not a great man like Philip Andrada. Give me a fleet, my orders, and my cause. That is all I need to do my duty."
She looks up and away, "He is... he was different. He had vision, and a surety of purpose that moved history itself by will alone."

[Line 8930] [Options Given: sdtu_hyderTalk3LeadershipCaden:"How about the Lion's Guard? Could Caden lead?"
sdtu_hyderTalk3LeadershipYou:"Sometimes the best leaders are those who don't want the position. Consider it."
sdtu_hyderTalk3LeadershipMe:"How about me?"
sdtu_hyderTalk3Back:"Let us talk of other things."]

[Line 8931] [Option Selected: "How about the Lion's Guard? Could Caden lead?"]
"Provided the navy did not stand in his way, provided the Supreme Executor was... dead. Then he would be the next in line."
"Could he lead?" She scoffs. "The Lion's Guard is his personal empire, his church, his cult, sucking up resources for a parade-navy. We could have made the Sindrian Diktat strong, even great, but Caden had to start a religion."
She looks away, "Andrada enjoyed the... the worship. He favored Caden, and it blinded him, impaired his judgment. Caden would martyr us all to the idol he's built of Andrada. I doubt even Macario could really control him. I'm sure he thinks he can."

[Line 8932] [Option Selected: "Sometimes the best leaders are those who don't want the position. Consider it."]
She just looks at you for a long moment, unspeaking.
The comms cut to a holding pattern.

[Line 8933] [Option Selected: "How about me?"]
She just looks at you for a long moment, unspeaking.
The comms cut to a holding pattern.

[Line 8935] [Option Selected: "Until we meet again."]
She just nods, distracted perhaps by the implications of your conversation.
The comms cut to a holding pattern.

[Line 8936] [Option Selected: "Glory to the Sindrian Diktat."]
She just looks at you. Like staring down the barrel of a coilgun.
The comms cut to a holding pattern.

SDTU try to talk to Macario before Hyder or Patrol
------------------------------
[Line 8943] After a short wait, Macario's image appears.
"Oh captain, so thoughtful of you to stop by on a social call," he says icily. "You do already have the file on the traitor, and the transponder code of their little flotilla. You have my full confidence in pulling this one off."
"Until then?" He says this like it's a question, but it isn't, because he's already killed the link.

SDTU step 5: Talk to Macario
------------------------------
[Line 8947] After a short wait, Macario's image appears. He looks like he is anticipating a tasty meal. 
"Captain, I am so pleased to have you join me once again. Deputy Star Marshal Hyder was not too upset? You didn't offend her sense of honor too deeply? But no, I should allow you to speak." He winks and taps a datapad.

[Line 8950] You have the Diktat patrol fleet officer in your brig for Macario. Best to address old business first.

[Line 8951] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderPrisonerOptA:"I have your traitorous officer ready to transfer."]

[Line 8952] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderPrisonerOptB:"I promised to let the prisoner go free on an independent world."]

[Line 8953] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderPrisonerOptC:"I transferred the prisoner to Hyder's custody." (lie)]

[Line 8955] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderReportHub:Don't mention the prisoner.]

[Line 8956] [Option Selected: "I have your traitorous officer ready to transfer."]
"You do?" Macario releases a quick breath, looking to the side, annoyed. "Fine, fine, send them over and we'll have that loose end trimmed."
He taps each hand once on his desk, then brings them together and looks at you attentively. "Now tell me about Hyder."

[Line 8957] [Option Selected: "I promised to let the prisoner go free on an independent world."]
"Really?" Macario looks amused, "How charming."
"Well, it doesn't hurt to give my operatives a bit of a challenge. Wouldn't want to let them go soft, eh?"
He taps each hand once on his desk, then brings them together and looks at you attentively. "Now tell me about Hyder."

[Line 8958] [Option Selected: "I transferred the prisoner to Hyder's custody." (lie)]
"Oh?" Macario's eyebrow raises. "But you didn't."

[Line 8958] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderPrisonerOptC1:"I assure you that I did."
sdtu_postHyderPrisonerOptC2:"Can you be absolutely certain about what I did and didn't do?"
sdtu_postHyderPrisonerOptC3:"Fine. I'll transfer the prisoner."]

[Line 8959] [Option Selected: "I assure you that I did."]
"Interesting," he says, then leans forward. "Don't disappoint me, captain. I think you're too smart to think I'm stupid."
He leans back again, and flicks his fingers. "Have the prisoner. I don't care. They'll end up dead one way or another. We like to tidy up loose ends around here. Now, about Hyder."

[Line 8960] [Option Selected: "Can you be absolutely certain about what I did and didn't do?"]
"Interesting," he says, then leans forward. "Don't disappoint me, captain. I think you're too smart to think I'm stupid."
He leans back again, and flicks his fingers. "Have the prisoner. I don't care. They'll end up dead one way or another. We like to tidy up loose ends around here. Now, about Hyder."

[Line 8961] [Option Selected: "Fine. I'll transfer the prisoner."]
"You're giving up so easily." he says, looking hurt. Then he leans forward. "Do as you will, captain, but do not disappoint me. You're too smart for that, aren't you?"
He leans back again, and flicks his fingers. "Well, do transfer the prisoner. We like to tidy up loose ends around here. Now, about Hyder."

[Line 8962] [Option Selected: "Unfortunately the prisoner died between capture and the present." (lie)]
"Yes yes, very sad, accidents and so forth," he says impatiently. "Tell me about Hyder."

[Line 8964] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderHatesYou:"Well, she hates you."]

[Line 8965] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderHegemonyOut:"I offered to arrange for her defection back to the Hegemony."]

[Line 8966] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderPromotion:"She says you've conspired to hold back her promotion to Grand Star Marshal."]

[Line 8967] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderCaden:"She doesn't believe Caden can successfully lead the Sindrian Diktat."]

[Line 8968] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderHerLead:"She doesn't want to lead the Sindrian Diktat."]

[Line 8969] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderSupply:"She blames you for the navy's supply problems."]

[Line 8970] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderMission1:"That's all I have to say."]

[Line 8971] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderReportLies:Consider some lies to tell Macario]

[Line 8972] [Option Selected: Consider some lies to tell Macario]
It may be to your advantage to tell Macario certain lies. He seems perceptive, so it is unlikely that you can get away with telling too many.

[Line 8973] You've already lied once to Macario. It might test his patience to push further.

[Line 8974] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderReportHub:Consider some truths to tell Macario]

[Line 8975] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderLieBacksCaden:"If it comes to it, Hyder would back Caden's leadership." (lie)]

[Line 8976] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderLieBacksMacario:"Hyder will back you as leader, though she is reluctant." (lie)]

[Line 8977] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderLieWantsToLead:"She thinks that no one could lead the Sindrian Diktat but herself." (lie)]

[Line 8978] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderLieWantsToDefect:"I believe that Hyder wants to defect to the Hegemony." (lie)]

[Line 8979] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderMission1:"That's all I have to say."]

[Line 8980] [Option Selected: "Well, she hates you."]
"Yes," Macario says, "I know that already."

[Line 8981] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderHateRespA:"She said you would fuel starships and feed crews with only lies, if you could."]

[Line 8982] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderHateRespB:"She said you cannot comprehend the concepts of honor, duty, and discipline."]

[Line 8983] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderHatesRespC:"She called you a meddlesome worm."]

[Line 8984] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderHatesRespD:"She said you've allowed the Volturnian Resistance to continue because you're incompetent and distracted."]

[Line 8985] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderHatesRespE:"She says that half of the operations you authorize are treasonous."]

[Line 8986] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderHatesRespF:"I'm just being thorough."]

[Line 8987] [Option Selected: "She said you would fuel starships and feed crews with only lies, if you could."]
Macario nods, thoughtfully rubbing his chin.

[Line 8988] [Option Selected: "She said you cannot comprehend the concepts of honor, duty, and discipline."]
"Hmm," he says, thinking. "Continue."

[Line 8989] [Option Selected: "She called you a meddlesome worm."]
Macario's eyebrows raise just a little, like he's just a tiny bit impressed by that one.

[Line 8990] [Option Selected: "She said you've allowed the Volturnian Resistance to continue because you're incompetent and distracted."]
"Interesting," he lies.

[Line 8991] [Option Selected: "She says that half of the operations you authorize are treasonous."]
"Only half?" Macario feigns surprise, "How charitable!"

[Line 8992] [Option Selected: "I'm just being thorough."]
"Of course. Well done." He drums his fingers impatiently.

[Line 8993] [Option Selected: "She says you've conspired to hold back her promotion to Grand Star Marshal."]
"Very good of her to notice," he says. "Pity there's nothing she can do about it."

[Line 8994] [Option Selected: "She doesn't believe Caden can successfully lead the Sindrian Diktat."]
"Hmm. Yes," Macario leans back, tapping his fingers together. "She is not wrong to see it. Ha! Caden. Imagine him in charge. Dress-up and parades while the worlds crumble."
"Not to worry," he says cheerfully, "Caden will perform quite adequately as figurehead provided he's given plenty of little distractions."

[Line 8995] [Option Selected: "She doesn't want to lead the Sindrian Diktat."]
"Good! You can't run a polity like a battleship!" Macario shakes his head, "Now if she'd simply recognize that the business of ruling should be handled by someone more capable."

[Line 8996] [Option Selected: "She blames you for the navy's supply problems."]
"At least she put it together," Macario checks a fingernail for dirt.
"Hyder will just have to use what she's got more effectively - and source her contraband more stealthily. I've found that many subordinates can thrive under pressure," he adds helpfully. 
"Hmm," he considers, "subject to circumstances, naturally."

[Line 8997] [Option Selected: "If it comes to it, Hyder would back Caden's leadership." (lie)]
"Fascinating," he leans forward.
"She always did admire Andrada's boldness and genius. And while Caden is no Andrada, he might serve as an acceptable substitute - the alternative would be chaos. Hyder can see that, and perhaps she is capable of putting aside her personal feelings for the greater good... yes, that could be it."

[Line 8998] [Option Selected: "Hyder will back you as leader, though she is reluctant." (lie)]
"Truly?" He leans back, rubbing his chin.
"This is an unexpected turn. As a trained military commander, perhaps Hyder recognizes - despite her personal feelings - that aligning herself with a powerful leader will lead to the best outcome."

[Line 8999] [Option Selected: "She thinks that no one could lead the Sindrian Diktat but herself." (lie)]
"Hyder? Leading the Sindrian Diktat?" He blurts out a single laugh, but his eyes are not amused.
"Nonsense, of course. But if she believes there was not another choice that could fit within her peculiar sense of ethics and psychological need for order... placing herself in what she thinks is control... yes, the motive could fit."
He sighs, looking up. "Ah, but what this would cost! The question then is how much of the navy will back her - a not insignificant number of that, let us be realistic, rather plebeian force even looks up to her. She's 'strict but fair', they say."
He shakes his head, distracted; working out risk analyses for future schemes.

[Line 9000] [Option Selected: "I offered to arrange for her defection back to the Hegemony."]
"Fascinating! And what did she say?" He leans forward, attention focused. "Did she accept?"

[Line 9000] [Options Given: sdtu_postHyderHegemonyOut2:"She didn't really answer. Just something about treason and execution."
sdtu_postHyderLieWantsToDefect:"Yes." (lie)]

[Line 9001] [Option Selected: "She didn't really answer. Just something about treason and execution."]
"Damnation!" Macario pounds a fist on the table, but he can't help but continue grinning. "Excellent work. I shall have to pursue this angle."
"It will be," he furiously rubs his hands together,"... fun."

[Line 9002] [Option Selected: "Yes." (lie)]
"No!" he exclaims, "And the Hegemony would have her?"
"This must be Rao's work." He starts rubbing his hands together furiously, "It fits, it fits. He possesses a low cunning honed during his criminal upbringing."
He looks up at you, his hands stopping their frenetic activity as if he just realized you could see it. "I admire Daud, of course. To accomplish so much, arisen from the parasite class to the top of command? It is truly incredible."
His hands start up again, his gaze wandering. "There is... much to do, much to think about..."

[Line 9004] "I must admit that you've underwhelmed me, captain." Macario leans back, hands held together, eyes on you. "Perhaps, stars forgive my manners, but perhaps you have not been entirely forthright?"
"I would so hate for the potential of our little collaboration to, how to put it... there's a Luddic expression, 'die on the vine' I believe? Now there's an image." He smiles charmlessly.
"Speaking of, let me provide you another opportunity to demonstrate your worth." He pauses a moment, then adds in a not-quite-threatening tone, "I'm sure by the end you'll agree that I can be very forgiving."

[Line 9005] He pauses, and seems to notice his own hands grasping one another, like they're trying to strangle each other. He lets them fall to the desk in a deliberate motion. 
"That was of mild interest. Confirming, I suppose, other sources," he leans back. "Ah, the rote work of intelligence gathering. It can't all end with a single, dramatic gunshot, eh?"
"Lucky for you, however, that's exactly what I've lined up with you in mind." He catches himself, amused, "No, no, not for you. One of Caden's agents on Umbra. I shall explain."

[Line 9006] "To tell the truth," Macario pauses to suppress a strange sound, like a hiccup, "you've been very illuminating." 
He leans back, hands grasping one another. "You could make a reasonable agent, were you more discreet." He smiles hollowly. "Far more discreet."
"Happily, I have just the thing, just the thing. The level of discretion is up to you; you'll find that I supervise with a light hand, contrary to the lies told about me. If you need to raze a few habs from orbit to extract an agent, why, then I accept your professional judgment. But let me explain..."

[Line 9007] [Option Selected: Continue]
Macario taps an unseen datapad.
"The Lion's Guard has its own intelligence section, of course. Wild about strong-jawed young men enforcing correct ideology and demonstrations of loyalty," he adopts a patiently patronizing tone. "Light on tradecraft."
"Sadly, one of Caden's agents on Umbra has been working for the insurrectionists from the beginning," he says. "Take the agent by force. Once Caden calms down, he will... approve of you cleaning up this embarrassment, you'll see. Just let him think he's in charge, that's all it takes."

[Line 9008] [Option Selected: "Confront Caden with his double-agent. Right."]
Macario smiles mirthlessly. "You'll get along splendidly provided you can pretend your greatest aspiration is to lick Andrada's boots."

[Line 9008] [Options Given: sdtu_macarioPostHyderEnd:End]

[Line 9009] [Option Selected: "How long have you known about this?"]
Macario smiles mirthlessly. "You're not without hope, captain."
"Now go nab that agent for the pompous clown. You'll get along splendidly with Caden provided you pretend that licking boots is your greatest aspiration."

[Line 9010] [Option Selected: "So this agent is working for the Resistance?"]
"Indeed!" Macario says, wide-eyed. "Imagine wasting years on such a hopeless cause! Then everything is undone because you were compromised by," he smiles with actual pleasure, dropping his voice into mock disappointment, "a friend."
"Oh, I shouldn't pay such attention to such small things. It is one of my few character flaws. But I do so enjoy the drama which plays between the lines of - and I'll be the first to admit - terribly dry intelligence reports. I do miss the old days, sometimes," he sighs.
"There was so much more time to conduct business... personally."

[Line 9011] [Option Selected: End]
"Off you go now." He stretches, straightens his uniform, then hits the comms cut-off without another word.

[Line 9011] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 9013] After a short wait, Macario's image appears.
"Captain, captain, captain," he smirks. "I eagerly await the results of your discussion with my good friend the Guard High Deputy Executor."
"Until then?" He says this like it's a question, but it isn't. He's already killed the link.

SDTU step 6: Extract agent from Umbra
------------------------------
[Line 9016] [Options Given: 2:sdtu_umbraRaidStart:Prepare a raid to extract Caden's agent]

[Line 9018] [Option Selected: Prepare a raid to extract Caden's agent]
Macario's file is highly detailed. It's clear that Sindrian Diktat intelligence has had sources embedded in both the Umbran ARC/Anti-affiliated insurrectionists as well as the Lion's Guard for quite some time.
The double-agent's key locations are clearly described, though their schedule is erratic. A clean capture will involve multiple simultaneous strikes at insurrectionist bunkers, at which point the op will definitely go hot. 
Sometimes a job simply requires making a bit of a mess.

[Line 9018] [Options Given: mktRaidNonMarket:Continue]

[Line 9019] You oversee the raid from your bridge; your cadre of merc officers who have collectively seen every side of every major Persean conflict of the last 50 cycles run tactical command.
Each squad is set up like a surgery, cool and precise. Then, all at once, hell is unleashed: breaching charges churn storms of dust and debris lit into strobing clouds of fire by weapon discharge. Sub-AIs build ghostly visualizations with milliradar, updating threat-tags in real-time for each marine's combat display.
The target is flagged off bone structure scanned by combat sensors and matched to Macario's file. The agent is bagged and restrained for extraction with only minor injuries.

[Line 9020] Your marine squads withdraw, leaving broken bulkheads, blaring alarms, and sporadic return-fire. The Umbran militia forces are still mobilizing and the port only now going into lockdown as the last marine shuttle lifts, jets kicking up volatile snow and dust to mix with leaking colonial atmo.
The double-agent is in the brig, attended to by medics. Broken bones, and lesser injuries. Par for the course.

[Line 9031] [Option Selected: "I need to find an agent working for the Sindrian Diktat."]
"An agent?" $HeOrShe looks suspicious, "If you know anything about a Sindie spy on Umbra, tell me now and I'll have 'em before a revolutionary tribunal before the day is out."

[Line 9032] [Option Selected: "I need to find an agent working for the Sindrian Diktat."]
"An agent?" $HeOrShe looks suspicious, "If you know anything about a Sindie spy on Umbra..." , tell me now and I'll have 'em before a revolutionary tribunal before the day is out."
$HeOrShe is distracted for a moment

[Line 9033] [Option Selected: "I need to find an agent working for the Sindrian Diktat."]
$HeOrShe is taken aback. "An agent? Here? I... I don't know what you're talking about. I mostly handle logistics."

[Line 9034] [Option Selected: "I need to find an agent working for the Sindrian Diktat."]
"An agent. Here?" A look of concern grows on her face.
"I can't say I'm surprised. If you have definitive intel about a Diktat spy on Umbra, then tell me. We'll assemble a revolutionary tribunal to sort this out."

[Line 9034] [Options Given: sdtu_umbraImoinuAgent2:Explain the true situation
sdtu_umbraTrickVIP:Explain as if they were a triple-agent (lie)
sdtu_umbraAskAgentBack:"Um, never mind actually."]

[Line 9035] [Option Selected: "Um, never mind actually."]
"Wait, what? You just said..."
$HeOrShe gives you a funny look.

[Line 9036] [Option Selected: Explain the true situation]
You explain that to get into Dolos Macario's trust, such as it is, you need to 'capture' an agent who Horacio Caden thinks is working for the Lion's Guard but has actually been working for the resistance. 
As an asset, they're already useless because Macario knows about their betrayal of the Sindrian Diktat. Their last act as an operative can be to help you 'prove' your dedication to the Spider's schemes.
It will be risky, but it should be possible for this agent to slip out of a death sentence by taking advantage of inter-service rivalry in the Sindrian Diktat.
Imoinu is silent, with a look of grave concern, as you explain.

[Line 9036] [Options Given: sdtu_umbraImoinuAgent3:"They're burned, Imoinu. This way still gets a win for the ARC and the United Front."]

[Line 9037] [Option Selected: "They're burned, Imoinu. This way still gets a win for the ARC and the United Front."]
She looks down, and sighs. Taking a moment to process.
Then looks back up. Her expression is resolute.
"You're right. We can make this work."

[Line 9037] [Options Given: sdtu_umbraImoinuAgent4:"And they'll come to no harm."
sdtu_umbraImoinuAgent4lie:"And they'll definitely come to no harm." (lie)]

[Line 9039] [Option Selected: "And they'll come to no harm."]
Arrangements are made, the agent - the strong-jawed image of the perfect Lion's Guard recruit - is briefed, then quietly transferred to your $shipOrFleet in a volatiles tank modified for smuggling human passengers.
"I hope you know what you're doing," Imoinu says.

[Line 9041] [Option Selected: "I need to find an agent working for the Sindrian Diktat."]
$HeOrShe is taken aback at first, then does a double take at a secondary display. 
"Wait, aren't you working for the Sindies? You've got some real jets coming and talking to me direct and admitting it." $HeOrShe turns aside, "Gonna have a real talk with traffic control... "
Then $heOrShe furiously taps something into a comm-interface. Self-satisfied, $heOrShe says "I've put out an alert. Might want to go running back to hide behind daddy Andrada."

[Line 9043] [Option Selected: Explain as if they were a triple-agent (lie)]
You explain that an agent who Horacio Caden thinks is working for the Lion's Guard, and who the resistance thinks is working for them, is in fact working for a separate branch of Sindrian Diktat intelligence entirely - under Dolos Macario's command. 
A triple agent, in other words. How else would you have such detailed inside information 'stolen' directly from Macario's INTSEC database?
It's a complex story, but you begin to see your suggested truth sink in to $personName.
"You mean to tell me they've been working against the uprising the whole time," she says, her outrage growing. "How do you have this information?"

[Line 9045] [Option Selected: "And I need this agent. To get into Macario's favor, infiltrate his schemes."]
She doesn't look pleased with the idea.
"We usually deal with traitors internally," she says. "And quickly."
"But considering your past contributions to the uprising, I think the revolutionary tribunal could be persuaded of the efficacy of giving you custody of the traitor."
Her chin raises, "For the United Front."

[Line 9045] [Options Given: sdtu_umbraTrickVIPending2:"For the United Front!"]

"You're a liar." $HeOrShe looks at you suspiciously.
"Imoinu warned me about you. And your lies. I don't know who you're working for, or who you think you're working for, but I'm thinking this conversation is done."
$HeOrShe hits the cut-off.

"I will," $heOrShe says, then mutes the feed for a moment, turning to a secondary display.
You watch one side of a short conversation play out, and $heOrShe turns back to you, $hisOrHer expression much friendlier.
"I'm sorry for that, captain. Imoinu swears you're a friend of the United Front of the Askonian Resistance who has made valuable material contributions to the cause." $HeOrShe nods respectfully, "Then let me say that I'm proud to call you a comrade."

[Line 9066] [Option Selected: "Persean League fleet intelligence. My real name is 'Siyavong'." (lie)]
"Finlay Siyavong? Ha!"
You can hear the aristocrat in her laugh. It is bitter, and a skill for pointed cruelty lurks there.
"I've met him, you fool. You're not Siyavong. You're a liar. Who sent you, Macario?"

If you're going to pull off this trick on one of the ARC leaders, you'd better do it quick, before Imoinu warns them.

[Line 9068] [Option Selected: "Your broad-mindedness is a virtue. Now about this agent..."]
"Of course. I appreciate your dedication to the cause. I'll have the traitor turned over to you, but... they really should properly be ours to subject to revolutionary justice."
$HeOrShe puts on a generous tone, "But we're for building bridges. For the United Front, right? So will come the day we will ask you for a favor, and we will expect it to be returned. For the Front."

"This fleet operates by command of the Askonia Revolutionary Council. The wealth of exploiters is designated for redistribution to fund the cause of sector liberation!"

[Line 9074] The comms connection flickers, then resolves.
"Clear signal, comrade-captain. We're ARC-aligned, just about to set off on an operation."
$HeOrShe leans in with a conspiratorial grin. "Been hearing rumors about a shake-up in the Sindies' officer corps... might be a good opportunity to, ah, redistribute some wealth around here. The more of us are raiding, the fewer they catch, right?"

[Line 9075] The comms connection flickers, then resolves.
"In the name of the Askonia Revolutionary Council, you are to face justice for your service to Sindrian Diktat imperialism and exploiters generally!"
"Lower your shields! Peaceful cooperation with the redistribution of exploited wealth shall be taken into account when you face the revolutionary tribunal."

[Line 9076] The comms connection flickers, then resolves.
"In the name of the Askonia Revolutionary Council, we greet you. We were in the middle of a wealth redistribution operation when we received a high-priority alert from our comrades on Umbra. It seems that a mercenary working for the Sindrian exploiters has been causing trouble."
"I'm sure I can count on you to inform us if your sensors find anything." $HeOrShe glances at another screen, impatient, but friendly. "We've got to get back to it. Bright burns."

They accept your offer gladly, and with a skillset which can only be described as 'eclectic', your purser believes a useful position can be found in your $shipOrFleet.

[Line 9081] [Option Selected: Offer them a job]
"No," the former agent says with a melancholic smile. "It's best if I do this on my own."

SDTU talk to Macario before Caden

"Oh captain, so thoughtful of you to stop by," he says icily. "Do go check up on Horacio Caden, will you? I've been so worried about him."
"Until then?" He says this like it's a question, but it isn't, because he's already killed the link.

[Line 9086] Horacio Caden, Guard High Deputy Executor of the Sindrian Diktat appears before you, looking satisfied with himself.

[Line 9087] "Independent fleet captain!" he roars, standing, "You have crossed the will of the Supreme Executor."
Looking down at the comms, his voice lowered and gravelly, Caden adopts a practiced pose of menace and authority.

[Line 9097] [Option Selected: "Macario discovered that your agent was a traitor. I have proof."]
"What? Treachery in my sacred Guard?" Caden shouts, turning red. He takes a deep breath, consciously composing himself.
"Despite my doubts about his commitment to Andradan ideals," he says in a more level tone, "I must admit that the Chief High Inspector-General is adept at rooting out sedition. Glory to the Chief High Inspector-General!"

"First, surrender the agent to my fleet," he adjusts his uniform after all the exertion.
"Then transmit this 'proof'. My staff shall provide me with an executive overview so that I may lay the appropriate punishment upon this traitor."
"I expect it will be severe," he adds, as if there was any question.

[Line 9099] [Option Selected: "I am nothing but loyal to the Supreme Executor. I can prove it!"]
"Then do so, spacer!" Caden shouts. "The swift sword of justice does not rest easy in the Sindrian Diktat!"
"Demonstrate your loyalty; transfer the agent to my fleet and I shall judge the situation and produce appropriate action." He lowers his voice dramatically, "Severe if necessary."

[Line 9100] [Option Selected: "I'm doing you a favor by rooting out treason. I have proof!"]
"I am the Guard High Deputy Executor of the Sindrian Diktat, spacer!" Caden shouts, turning red. "I do not need a... favor." He spits the hated word.
"Nonetheless, I shall judge the right of your claim. Demonstrate your loyalty now! Surrender this agent and explain yourself!"
He adjusts his uniform after all the exertion. "Quickly, now. The swift sword of justice does not rest easy in the Sindrian Diktat."

[Line 9101] [Option Selected: "I am not acting under Hegemony authority. Your agent is a traitor."]
"Ha! See now the quality of loyalty the decadent Hegemony inspires!" Caden seems to address his bridge crew, holding his arm out like a showman demonstrating wares.
"You have chosen correctly, spacer, to bring this alleged traitor to me. The swift sword of justice does not rest long in the Sindrian Diktat!" 
He adjusts his uniform after all the exertion. "Now; surrender this agent. Then I shall judge the situation and take appropriately decisive action."

[Line 9102] [Option Selected: "Your agent was a traitor, working for the rebels of Umbra."]
"A bold accusation from spacer trash!" Caden shouts, waving a fist. "But then perhaps you have heard how I despise traitors to our Glorious Movement!"
"You have chosen correctly, spacer, to bring this alleged traitor to me. The swift sword of justice does not rest long in the Sindrian Diktat!" 
He adjusts his uniform after all the exertion. "Now; surrender this agent. Then I shall judge the situation and take appropriately decisive action."

[Line 9103] [Option Selected: "I am nothing but loyal to the Supreme Executor. I can prove it!" (lie)]
"Then do so, spacer!" Caden shouts. "The swift sword of justice does not rest easy in the Sindrian Diktat!"
"Demonstrate your loyalty; transfer the agent to my fleet and I shall judge the situation and produce appropriate action." He lowers his voice dramatically, "Severe if necessary."

[Line 9108] [Option Selected: "Macario ordered the arrest, so I will deliver the traitor to him." (lie)]
You hold a legitimate agent of the Askonian resistance. Turning them over to either Caden or Macario would only assist the Sindrian Diktat's repression.
On the other hand, emphasizing that Macario overstepped his authority might drive a wedge between him and Caden. 
"Do not test my patience, spacer!" Caden is turning red again, "Here, I am the representative of the Supreme Executor's ultimate and unassailable will! To oppose my demand is tantamount to an attack on the state - degenerate terrorism, sedition, treason, corruption of the public corpus!"

[Line 9109] [Option Selected: "Macario ordered the arrest. I've already delivered the agent to him." (lie)]
You hold an agent of the Askonian resistance, and promised their safety in exchange for cooperation.
If Caden believes Macario has the agent, and Macario believes Caden does, then considering how little they appear to trust one another... 
"Do not test my patience, spacer!" Caden's shout interrupts your thoughts. He's turning red again.
"Here, I alone represent the Supreme Executor's ultimate and unassailable will! To oppose my demand is tantamount to an attack on the state - degenerate terrorism, sedition, treason, corruption of the public corpus!"

Macario, of course, doesn't seem to particularly care about the fate of this agent. But his overstepping of authority might drive a wedge between him and Caden if you could put the idea in Caden's head. 
"Do not test my patience, spacer!" Caden is turning redder again, "Here I am the representative of the Supreme Executor's ultimate will! To oppose my demand is tantamount to an attack on the state - degenerate terrorism, sedition, and treason!"

Caden turns away, fuming.
"The presumption of that two-faced traitor! He should not push me, for if I but willed it he would be executed on the spot."
"Spacer!" Caden is back, redder than ever. "Your ignorance is pitiable, so I shall correct it: in our great tower of authority Philip Andrada sits at the apex."
He raises a hand, fingers pinched, as if showing you a model.

"Dolos Macario is a mere bureaucrat, one of many who operate the ministries of the Supreme Executor's machinery of state. I'm afraid his excessive contact with terrorists and degenerates has given him impure imaginings regarding his position in our Great Movement. It is my duty to correct his errors."

He drops the expression.
"My loyalty to the vision of Philip Andrada is beyond reproach. I am his right hand. If what you say is true, spacer, then what exactly is Macario playing at?"

You explain Macario's words describing Caden as liking to 'play dress-up and have parades' you can see the color rising again in his face.
"I shall... let him talk as he wishes. Let him show his true nature," Caden says with cold anticipation. "He will scheme his way into his own trap, and his downfall will be all the more satisfying."

You watch the thoughts ooze through Caden's head.
"Which... would be exactly why Macario would select her as his puppet. She possesses a mere handful of subjective beliefs that could be twisted by a man used to operating within the disorderly mindset of criminal degenerates..."
"It is preposterous," he shakes his head once, medals set a-jingle, disturbed by the notion that such forces would align against him. One can't help but suspect his dismissal of the idea is for show.

"Dolos Macario is a strange man to rely on you. Such an... unreliable element."
Caden waves a hand dismissively, "No offense intended of course. As an outsider you do not undergo the discipline and spiritual cleansing induced by total submission to transcendent Andradan ideology. I feel it would be more appropriate for matters within the Sindrian Diktat to be settled by true followers of the Great Movement, not decadent itinerants."

Caden paces, enjoying another chance to lecture you.
"Few of the Grand Star Marshal's many virtues apply to Vice Star Marshal Hyder, however. She does not burn with passion for the Andradan ideology as is fitting for senior officers in our glorious Sindrian Diktat."
"You see, from time to time the state requires a bitter medicine which kills the weak so that the strong may more fully thrive. Powers must be tipped toward a vigorous and stable future! The Supreme Executor saw sickness in the Hegemony, and that is exactly why he compelled the birth of a new order from the dying of the old!"

"Now." He halts, and turns.
"Mind your open talk, spacer." There's a threat in his tone.
"It could be considered support of terrorism, anti-Andradan sedition, and spreading malicious rumors to undermine legitimate authority. If," a smug smile grows, "I were to judge it so."

"You sound like Macario's more paranoid ramblings."
He flicks imagined dust from his uniform. "Hyder is a small woman of small vision. She sees only housekeeping of numbers and petty rules. The Lion's Guard under my command is invincible: outfitted with the best equipment and leadership inspired by Andradan principles; there is no finer fleet in the Sector. If it came to a contest of main-force..." 
He pauses, and perhaps the calculus of what it would mean for the Diktat to expend its own navy on a civil war sinks in.
"It won't come to that," he concludes with an air of confidence.

[Line 9155] [Option Selected: "Macario. He only really believes in himself."]
"Hm," Caden looks worried, almost. "He is quite insistent about his loyalty to the vision of the Supreme Executor, and to myself personally."
He looks down, brow furrowed. "But Macario has played larger tricks before. He was born a liar. Did you know he came from a Luddic family?" 
Caden smiles cruelly, "Oh yes. Of course, he had no faith. Never has and never will. And at the Battle of Salus he was a mere intelligence analyst, a junior officer! I suspect he's never accepted that Andrada did not truly favor him, and never completely trusted him."
"A web of intrigue is nothing compared to the might of a full warfleet. When the time comes, Dolos might realize this." Caden nods, satisfied at his own reasoning.

[Line 9158] "Naturally, I do not need the assistance of outsiders like yourself. But."
He looks slightly up and to the side - a practiced pose to emphasize his retreating jawline. "It is the sign of good intuition to align yourself with the Great Movement, to pledge yourself toward a cause which, though you are ignorant of its particulars, shines with the genius of Philip Andrada. Study well his writings and you may begin to understand the glorious future which awaits."

[Line 9199] [Option Selected: "He thinks you are unreliable in terms of loyalty to the, uh, ideology of Philip Andrada."]
"Well yes, that's obviously true and he should well know it without an unusually helpful spacer pointing it out for him."
Macario sighs, irritated. "I am surrounded, surrounded by idiots," he mutters.
"Captain," he sits up, speaking clearly now. "I suppose if it works, it works. I would be bored silly if it weren't for the inventiveness of Luddic zealots and the Hegemony's meddling. Are you familiar with Orcus Rao? Oh, he's a character. A worthy opponent, I think. Indulge me a moment, I think you'll find the comparison with yourself amusing..." 

[Line 9199] [Options Given: sdtu_postCaden2:Continue]

[Line 9200] [Option Selected: "I told him that you secretly admire his ideological commitment."]
Macario raises his hands to his brow as if he's suddenly developed a headache.
"That... is absurd." His hands come down, "And he believed it?"
"Perhaps I am simply too intelligent to place myself fully without the thought processes of such a thick-headed, pompous oaf. Captain," he looks up, the color back in his face, "You astound me."

[Line 9200] [Options Given: sdtu_postCaden2:Continue]

[Line 9201] [Option Selected: "Caden told me you were raised by Luddics."]
Something tightens on Macario's face, but he plays casual. You've got him off-balance.
"Did he say that?" He chuckles, then assembles a smile. "The man must trust you." 
"You see captain? Just follow my lead and you will get results. People are not so complex. You just need to know where to... pull."

[Line 9201] [Options Given: sdtu_postCaden2:Continue]

[Line 9202] After a brief wait, Macario appears before you.
"Oh captain, captain, captain. That didn't go very well, did it." He shakes his head. "You didn't follow my advice, did you."
He holds very still now. "You tried to get clever, didn't you. Do you see what happens when you try to be clever? All you had to do was follow instructions."
The muscles under his skin tighten, and he draws in breath to speak...

[Line 9202] [Options Given: sdtu_postCaden2:Continue]

[Line 9203] [Option Selected: Continue]
"It's all about building the pieces of a story - and with Caden so eager to believe stories, Hyder so eager to follow rules, why, it makes my work simple!" He brings his hands together, satisfied.
"I tell you, captain, I would be bored silly if it weren't for the inventiveness of Luddic zealots and the Hegemony's meddling. Are you familiar with Rao? Oh, he's a character. A worthy opponent, I think. Indulge me a moment, I think you'll find the comparison with yourself amusing..."

[Line 9204] [Option Selected: Continue]
Some kind of alert chirps on Macario's side. He holds up a finger indicating that you should wait, and he turns aside with a killing look on his face.
He opens a secondary comms, "This had better be very important," he says, almost sing-song.
His expression goes slack, processing what he's being told. Then his brow furrows. "Acknowledged," he says, then turns back to you with a fragile smile.
"I must beg you for a quick favor, dear captain."

[Line 9204] [Options Given: sdtu_postCadenInt2:Let him talk.

sdtu_postCadenIntBegPlease:"Beg? Oh, please proceed."]

The facade of a smile draws thinner, a delicate thing, like a razor's edge.

[Line 9207] [Option Selected: Let him talk.]
Macario closes his eyes for a moment. "A matter of great urgency and interest has arisen. I need you to make a fast intercept to this transponder location, coming in through the fringe jump-point. One of my, ah, agents who has been working in Tri-Tachyon space is being pursued. They have information of enormous value."
"Your reward upon securing the integrity of this information and, secondarily, this agent, would be commensurate with the value of said information." 
He takes a breath. "That value is immense."

[Line 9207] [Options Given: sdtu_postCadenEnd:Continue]

SDTU step 9: EMERGENCY_INTERCEPT
------------------------------
[Line 9213] Your sensors officer surveys the dead and cooling debris field; summary scans indicate no active vac-suits or intact ship compartments. Macario's agent is almost certainly dead.
The transponder, however, is still alive - barely.
A salvage drone retrieves the upper portion of a burnt and blasted corpse. Your ops chief personally extracts the intact datacore, just a quick twist with a pair of pliers.
It awaits your inspection.

[Line 9213] [Options Given: sdtu_debrisData0:Inspect the core]

[Line 9214] [Option Selected: Inspect the core]
Your technology officer makes quick work of cleaning up the core and setting up a short-range EM field interface.
It doesn't take long for a report: the contents of the filesystem held on the core are encrypted, of course, by Tri-Tachyon's best.
There is readable metadata, however.

[Line 9214] [Options Given: sdtu_debrisData1:View the metadata]

[Line 9215] [Options Given: sdtu_debrisData2:Continue]

[Line 9216] [Option Selected: Continue]
"It's hard to say," your tech officer looks hesitant. "I mean, Andrada. A list of names? I'd say family of some kind, but it doesn't match anything in the public demography file on Philip Andrada."
"But um, it comes down to the metadata. If you examine that, all of the encrypted archives were created over a period of about a month back in cycle 182. And then all them except ANDRADA-PERSEUS have been updated within the last week or so."

[Line 9216] [Options Given: sdtu_debrisData3:"What happened to Perseus?"]

[Line 9217] [Option Selected: "What happened to Perseus?"]
"Or what didn't happen," your tech officer glances up, and, nervous at being seen as impertinent, quickly continues. 
"Perseus was last updated near the end of cycle 205. As if, well, as if a telemetry feed stopped. Or lost contact."

[Line 9217] [Options Given: sdtu_debrisData4:"Or someone died."]

[Line 9218] [Option Selected: "Or someone died."]
Your technology officer nods at the implication.
"I'll throw the standard breakers at the decrypt job, but it's theoretically impossible it'll crack before the end of the universe. If you want to read these files, we're going to need another way in."
You have backups of the files made.
Whatever has Macario got his fingers into?

The mercs eyebrows raise and $heOrShe takes a moment to refer to a secondary display as if to confirm your claim.
"I see," $heOrShe says. "Very inconvenient. Nonetheless, I must insist."

[Line 9233] [Option Selected: "What are you doing?"]
$HeOrShe pauses for a moment, then carefully says "I... request... that you stay clear of the nearby debris field until it has dispersed."

[Line 9234] [Option Selected: "I was expecting to meet a ship or fleet here."]
"Mm," $heOrShe looks just a touch uncomfortable.
"Then I would suggest that waiting around will not be a productive use of time."

[Line 9235] [Option Selected: "Who are you working for?"]
"Ah," $heOrShe frowns. "My mission parameters require that I not reveal the identity of my employer. Enormous penalty clause there."

[Line 9236] [Option Selected: "I'll just be going now."]
"Burn bright... and far," $heOrShe says.

[Line 9236] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 9237] [Option Selected: "I must investigate that debris field."]
"You must not," the merc says without blinking.
"I shall inform you now that I have been tasked with using deadly force to ensure that the debris remains untouched."

[Line 9237] [Options Given: sdtu_mercReact1onMyWay:"I'll be on my way, then."
sdtu_mercUseForce:"Then use force to stop me."]

[Line 9238] [Option Selected: "Then use force to stop me."]
The merc closes $hisOrHer eyes with a sigh. "You've put me in a difficult and, worse, potentially very expensive position, captain."
"Please don't mention this incident to anyone."
The comms cut. Your tactical officer informs you that the merc's fleet appears to be standing down.

[Line 9238] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 9240] $HeOrShe lifts a finger to $hisOrHer ear, and sits up as if $heOrShe has been told something important. "Wait, you are $playerName. Commissioned auxiliary of the Hegemony?"
"My apologies, captain. I have specific orders not to interfere with your activities, and," $heOrShe double-checks a datapad, "It seems I am to, um, render assistance insofar as it does not compromise my mission."

[Line 9241] [Option Selected: "What are you doing?"]
"My apologies, but my orders are to not provide operational information to any outside party except insofar as is required to carry out the mission. Though, of course, your status confers something of a loophole..."
$HeOrShe thinks for a moment. "I have attacked and destroyed a few ships that my employer wished destroyed. I am to ensure there are no survivors, and allow no rescue attempt."

[Line 9242] [Option Selected: "I was expecting to meet a ship or fleet here."]
"Mm," $heOrShe looks uncomfortable. "If you were expecting to meet someone on the small fleet I just destroyed, that puts us in a somewhat awkward position."
"Business, you know. ...I hope you weren't close?" The merc makes an awkward shrug.

[Line 9243] [Option Selected: "Who are you working for?"]
"Ah," $heOrShe frowns. "I am specifically required to not identify my employer. Mission parameters, you see."
The merc winks, "But I'm sure a clever captain could infer important facts due to the disposition I've been ordered to show toward a Hegemony-commissioned captain."
"And I must say," $heOrShe stretches and lets out a sigh. "The nightlife at Ragnar Complex is rather a disappointment."

[Line 9244] [Option Selected: "I'll be on my way, then."]
The merc $post makes the vac-ops 'all safe' sign with $hisOrHer hand.
"Bright burns and profitable runs."

[Line 9249] The comms open with a soft chime.
"Independent $shipOrFleet," the merc says in a perfunctory monotone, "I have been contracted to destroy any ship or fleet," $heOrShe pauses politely so you may understand that you are just such a ship or fleet, "-which interferes with the debris field you just plundered. This communication is made not as a negotiation, but simply a matter of professional courtesy."
$HeOrShe produces a perfectly bland customer-service smile then hits the comms cut-off.

The merc pauses, lifting a finger to $hisOrHer ear as if being told something on a private channel.
"You are $playerName," $heOrShe says, looking at you anew. "Commissioned auxiliary of the Hegemony."

"My apologies, captain. I have specific orders not to interfere with your activities, and," $heOrShe double-checks a datapad, "It seems I am to, um, render assistance insofar as it does not compromise my mission."
"You've put me in an awkward spot," the merc rubs $hisOrHer brow.  "But I suppose I must simply let you go. Bright burns?"

"Ah, there was one more thing," the merc rubs $hisOrHer brow. "Oh yes. You should visit the Ragnar Complex, in the Valhalla system. Great opportunities for someone like... you." $HeOrShe pauses, eyes fixed and unblinking to ensure that you got the message.
That accomplished, $heOrShe transitions to a thin smile, as if this business was concluded to everyone's satisfaction. "Bright burns," $heOrShe says.

[Line 9256] He wastes no time with greetings or posturing.
"I would not be so naive to ask you to delete your copy of this data," Macario says with inhuman calm. "I'm sure your people are quite capable of creating a thorough charade of compliance."

sdtu_newsEndSale:"My silence is very much for sale."]

[Line 9257] [Option Selected: "What happened to Perseus?"]
Macario stares unblinking. "Have I so underestimated you?"

[Line 9258] [Option Selected: "Who are these seven Andradas?"]
"Andrada, of course." Macario simply raises an eyebrow, "I thought that was obvious."

[Line 9259] [Option Selected: "Are these the heirs of Andrada? Only six left."]
"On so few the future hangs, captain," Macario says hollowly, unblinking.

[Line 9260] "Tragic," Macario says automatically. "Isn't it."

[Line 9261] [Option Selected: "I appreciate you not wasting my time. So was Perseus your doing?"]
"You wound me with the accusation, captain," Macario says with a hint of cold amusement.

[Line 9262] [Option Selected: "My silence is very much for sale."]
"Naturally," Macario says, taking a moment to tap at a datapad.

[Line 9263] "There will come a time soon when decisions must be made, dear captain," he takes a moment to tap at a datapad.

"That is all captain," he says, re-asserting a mask of calm. "For now. I'm sure we shall speak again soon."

The old man looks like a hermit who's been living out in the wastes for countless cycles. His robes are dusty, his skin creased and tanned.
He smiles mysteriously as you approach, and you can see he is accompanied by a mop-haired kid, a youth of not yet 20 cycles.
"I have a feeling that you're not the captain we're looking for," he says amiably. "Your $shipOrFleet is far too large. We seek simple transport, not a warfleet."
With that, he puts his hands together and gives a nod, almost a bow.

[Line 9276] [Option Selected: DEV start "Passage to Volturn" / ANH]
The old man looks like a hermit who's been living out in the wastes for countless cycles. His robes are dusty, his skin creased and tanned.
He smiles mysteriously as you approach, and speaks both to you and the mop-haired kid, more a youth of not yet 20 cycles.
"I have a good feeling about this one."

[Line 9277] [Options Given: anh_cantinaAccept:"Okay, you have a deal."]

[Line 9287] [Option Selected: "Let me guess- you need transport, no need to involve the authorities."]
"You are quite correct, captain," the old man says. "You shall be paid 10,000 credits upon arrival in Volturn, in the Askonia system. It is as you say: we should like to avoid any patrols or inspections."

[Line 9287] [Options Given: anh_cantinaAccept:"It's a deal."
anh_cantinaAuthorities:"Why do the authorities want you so badly?"]

[Line 9288] [Option Selected: "Why do the authorities want you so badly?"]
The youth starts to speak, "Because he's a- " and the old man lifts a finger in warning, shutting the kid up.
"Just some old history that most people have forgotten by now. It is best that you not ask, I think."

[Line 9290] [Option Selected: "If you're some kind of terrorist, I want to know.";['anh_cantinaKnowMore0']]
The old man makes a show of exchanging a glance with the kid, who looks worried. "I don't think we look like terrorists, do you?"

[Line 9291] [Option Selected: "It's probably best that I not ask."]
The old man's smile returns, like he expected you to say this.

[Line 9292] [Option Selected: "If you're some kind of terrorist, I want to charge more."]
The old man nods like he expected this. The kid looks offended, "We could buy an old ship for that much! I bet I could get it working in no time, then we just-" the old man raises a hand to quiet him.
"I can offer you 17,000 credits upon arrival," he says calmly, "and no more."
The kid crosses his arms and sulks.

[Line 9293] [Option Selected: "I'd be careful about trusting your feelings around here, old man."]
"They led you to me, did they not?" he says, as if it means anything.
The kid gets a look of awe, eating this line up like ancient wisdom.

[Line 9293] [Options Given: anh_cantinaAskFeelings1:"Sure, whatever."
anh_cantinaAskFeelings2:"I suppose they did."]

[Line 9295] [Option Selected: "I suppose they did.";['anh_cantinaAskFeelings1']]
The old man says nothing, the hint of a smile on his lips. The kid looks back and forth between you and the old man, waiting to see what will happen next.

[Line 9296] [Option Selected: "What's with the robot, got some kind of AI in there?"]
"You don't need to worry about our little friend here," the old man says.

anh_cantinaRobot2:"Actually, I need to know if that thing is safe."

[Line 9297] [Option Selected: "I don't need to worry about it."]
The old man nods, satisfied.

[Line 9298] [Option Selected: "Actually, I need to know if that thing is safe."]
The kid finds his tongue. "Of course it's safe! We bought it from some scavengers and then I took it apart and put it back together myself." 
It sounds like he's been holding back an outburst this whole time.
"I can fix anything!" he adds.

[Line 9298] [Options Given: anh_cantinaRobot3:"Sure. If I need some farm equipment repaired I'll let you know."
anh_cantinaRobot4:"I could use a junior engineer in my fleet."
anh_cantinaRobot5:"So what's this about, old man?"
]

[Line 9299] [Option Selected: "Sure. If I need some farm equipment repaired I'll let you know."]
This sets the kid off. 
"I'm not just some dune-farmer," the youth says, raising his voice, "I'm a great pilot just like-" the old man reaches out and touches him on the shoulder. The kid takes the hint.
"What my young friend means to say is that we have another task in mind."

[Line 9300] [Option Selected: "I could use a junior engineer in my fleet."]
The youth is taken aback by this respect granted to him by a space captain. He looks like he's actually thinking about it. "I can't, I mean thank you, but I'm a great pilot just like-" the old man reaches out, holding him back. 
"What my young friend means to say is that his destiny lies elsewhere."


[Line 9301] [Option Selected: "So what's this about, old man?"]
"A simple run to Volturn. You'll be paid and then you can forget all about us," the old man says, his mysterious smile returning.

[Line 9302] [Option Selected: "Not worth my time. Find someone else."]
The anger and disappointment on the kid's face is palpable. The old man puts a hand on his shoulder, with just a small motion diverting the rush of youthful emotion.
As you step away, you overhear the old man speaking softly, "There is another..."

[Line 9302] [Options Given: anh_cantinaReturn:Continue]

[Line 9303] [Option Selected: "It's a deal."]
You make arrangements for the old man, the youth, and their robot to be shuttled to your $shipOrFleet.
They don't seem especially dangerous. Surely no one in the Hegemony or Sindrian Diktat is putting much effort into tracking their movements.

[Line 9308] "Captain," the Sindrian Diktat officers says in a level tone, "We have reason to believe that you carry a terrorist known to the Sindrian Security Directorate."
$HeOrShe barely lifts a finger, and a supplementary data package is transmitted to you. Your comms officer attaches the contents to a secondary display: it's the old man from Asharu. Much younger in this looping holo, wearing the military uniform of some minor polity instead of robes.
"It would expedite my investigation if this individual found his way to my flagship." $HeOrShe smiles the coldest, smallest smile in the Sector.

In a briefing room, the old man watches the holo of his younger self with a wistful smile. The kid is there, looking terrified. Their robot beeps and performs some kind of idling cycle.

Unfortunately the kid speaks up. "Wow, is that you? I knew it! You were part of-" The old man holds up a hand to stop the outburst. He closes his eyes.

[Line 9312] [Option Selected: "Care to explain?";['anh_diktatPatrolStall30']]
"Now there's a man I have not seen in a long, long time," he says quietly. "By now, even I was starting to think he might be dead."
He looks to you now, a glimmer of that younger self appearing in his face. "Give me over to them, captain. The boy must go to Volturn without me. He will be safe if they have me."
The kid is aghast. "No!" he shouts, "They'll kill you!"

The old man looks more tired than surprised. 
The kid shouts, "Great! You can fight 'em off with your $shipOrFleet! I can help at the gunnery station, I'm a great shot. I promise I'll be careful and-"
You and the old man exchange a look. "Come, young one," the old man says, taking the youth by the shoulder. "We must let the good captain get to work."

[Line 9314] [Option Selected: "As you wish."]
"What!?" the kid shouts, "You can't do that. You have to fight! You have a $shipOrFleet! You're just going to let those Diktat goons order you around?" He lunges at you, and is bodily intercepted by the arm of one of your guards. After a yelp and a moment of struggle, the kid folds to an electrostun rod.
The old man does not give the commotion even a glance. Instead, his eyes are steady on yours. Looking deeply for something.
"He has so much to learn, $playerName." He looks thoughtful, "Fate may surprise us yet."

[Line 9315] [Options Given: anh_diktatPatrolStall4:"Take them away."]

[Line 9317] The Diktat officer looks less patient now, the polite smile barely a memory.

The smile disappears, like it barely existed. 
"I see."
The Diktat officer turns away, motioning to $hisOrHer bridge crew, "In the name of the Supreme Executor I order you to power down your systems and prepare to be boarded," then looks back over $hisOrHer shoulder, and adds "Our search will be... thorough."

Then anger cracks across $hisOrHer face, "That is the most preposterous lie I've ever-" 
A ping from the other bridge comes across the comms, interrupting the beginning of $hisOrHer tirade. The Diktat officer gives you a killing look then exchanges quiet words with some underlings; your comms officer gives you a tentative nod.

[Line 9329] [Option Selected: Continue]
Your quick-thinking bridge crew has provided a fake manifest on your behalf, of course.
Of course they would have a plausible but misleading pre-generated crew and passenger manifest ready for just such a situation. If you offered it with enough confidence - and very little delay - it might just work.
You wait with saintly patience as the Diktat officer has an underling run the fake manifest through the latest Diktat search and verification algorithms.

You hear an angry call of "Run it again!" that perhaps was not intended to get picked up by comms. It takes a few more minutes.

She frowns, considering your claim.
"Could be. We don't think there's been a legitimate holo-cast from him for at least a cycle."
She shifts the tilt of her head. "But this raises two questions. One, why should we believe anything that comes from that ghoul Macario's mouth? Two, and this is the more pressing question to me, why in the name of Old Earth are you having personal conversations with Dolos Macario, Andrada's chief torturer and spymaster?"

"It is," she nods. "And I'm glad you can see that, despite the... difficulties."

imoinuKato_saySalute2b:"You mean, being stuck on a pirate-infested icecube with no fleet."]

[Line 9417] [Option Selected: "You mean, being stuck on a pirate-infested icecube with no fleet."]
She opens her mouth, then pauses, and closes it.
"Yes. That's... fair."

[Line 9418] [Option Selected: "Difficulties?";['imoinuKato_saySalute2b']]
"The ARC navy is... it's mostly opportunistic pirates. A few have good ideology, but most..." She sighs. "It's not easy."
"The United Front is united more by bickering and infighting than solidarity. The Charterists are eternally fundraising, keeping all the credits for running their tours and parties instead of fighting. The Volturnian Self Defense Covenant puts up a real fight, but they're held back from true revolutionary consciousness by the reactionary elements of Luddic ideology. So all they can do is bleed out into that ocean of theirs..."

imoinu_goVolturn:"What if you go to Volturn. Help the, um, Volturn Covenant?"]

[Line 9419] [Option Selected: "Why not go back to Kazeron and find a way to support the fight from inside the League?"]
"No..." She shakes her head.
"On Kazeron, the gens are too dominant. The moment I stepped off the shuttle they'd have some doctor declare me insane and lock me up in an estate dome on the dark side of Draugr so I stop 'embarrassing our gens'."

[Line 9420] [Option Selected: "What if you go to Volturn. Help the, um, Volturn Covenant?"]
"Yeah, maybe." She sounds entirely unenthusiastic.
"The Luddics either get upset or preachy if you try to explain proper revolutionary consciousness to them. Don't get me wrong, they've got good people, but..."
She shakes her head. "I'd go crazy. Or they would."
"Don't get me wrong though, the ARC has a network on Volturn too, of course. We're not as strong as the VSDC, but we're fighting too! The problem is supplies, funding..."

[Line 9421] [Option Selected: "It seems a doomed cause. Don't you want to go home?"]
"I see now." Her eyes narrow.
"Tell me, how much did my grandmother pay you to come admonish me? You can tell her she's wasted her credits. Again."

imoinuKato_sayMotherB:"Are you telling me I could have been paid for this?"]

Her eyes narrow.
"'A doomed cause'? And you claim to be a deep-cover agent who is part of the ARC."
"I think you're a liar," she says.
"A hired killer for execs and admirals, a profiteer selling drugs to the masses with one hand and harvesting black market organs with the other."

She considers your reply. "Huh."
"For once, I don't think you're lying." Imoinu looks away for a moment. Her resolve hardens again. "Whatever."
"And what are you really? A hired killer for execs and admirals? Profiteer from the organs harvested from the desperate masses? Go suck vacuum."
She slams the cut-off.

[Line 9426] [Option Selected: "I truly have no idea what you're talking about."]
She considers your reply. "Huh."
"So you're not working for her." Imoinu looks away for a moment.
"Yeah, she wants me back to be a good gens-heir. Says I'm shaming the family. And if I am? Good. They deserve it for what's been done in the name of Gens Kato."

[Line 9428] [Option Selected: "That's rich talk coming from a Gens baby."]
"Whatever." She scowls. "At least I chose to make some good from my position!"
"What have you ever done? Acted the hired killer for execs and admirals? Profited from the organs harvested from the desperate masses?"
"I don't need your lectures." She slams the cut-off.

"Um."
Imoinu gives you a look of re-assessment, the sort that seems to ask if the subject has all of their reactor plating installed correctly, so to speak.
"Thanks," she manages. "I uh, I'll... look him up. If I need an artist."

[Line 9440] [Option Selected: "I'm not sure. I just visited a slum where he was probably squatting."]
"Um." Imoinu gives you a look of re-assessment, the sort that asks, 'Is this person crazy?'
"Uh. Thanks. I'll... look him up if I need somewhere to stay on Westernesse."

"Is that the same Gargoyle who did the hack of the Prime Demarchon's All-League Holo Address in '02?"

"There are a lot of so-called hackers out there claiming to be 'the' Gargoyle."

"Huh. Let's call it a 'maybe', then. Good enough for a try- if what you say is true." 
She reaches over and taps at an interface.
"If you get this cryptokey to your Gargoyle, we can see if they're the real deal. And if they're willing to help."

"We'll see." She nods, then pauses.
"Thank you," she says awkwardly.

She gives you a funny look.

"An old man and a kid?" She looks confused, mostly at your implied expectation that she would know what you're talking about.

"And what have you ever done? Acted the hired killer for execs and admirals? Profited from the organs harvested from the desperate masses?"
"I don't need your lecture." She slams the cut-off.

[Line 9454] Imoinu holds up a hand.
"I understand that you're trying to help, but building a revolutionary movement is more than just collecting completely random people."
"Well," she reconsiders, "It's a part of it, I guess. But I don't need you for that. Well-"
She lets out an exasperated breath.

[Line 9456] [Option Selected: "Do you need armaments? Supplies? Credits?"]
"I thank you for your offer, captain, but I'm still distributing your previous support. It takes about a month to get everything where it needs to go."
She pauses, hesitant. Then explains, the frustration clear in her expression.
"The problem is if we stockpile too much materiel, credits, supplies... they start to 'get lost'. We work with a large number of individuals who are not... as ideologically committed to the ARC, to the uprising, as we should hope."

Kanta's Protection
------------------------------
[Line 9469] Cydonia nods stiff-necked, the tiniest insinuation of a bow, then addresses you.
"See now how Captain $playerName crawls before her worshipfulness!" He turns slowly, projecting his piercing voice to all corners. "Safe under the protection of the merciless Warlord Kanta; safe like a little fetus in a birthing tank. See how those prosper who appease her desires!"
He spins back toward you. "Besides supplicating yourself before our queen of blood," he hisses, "Why have you come?"

[Line 9469] [Options Given: kpLeave2:Leave]

[Line 9470] Cydonia shakes his head slowly, arms crossed, looking down at you with showy disapproval.
He gives a shrill shout, "See this wretched worm before you!" Turning slowly to address all the court, he berates you. "This blind simpleton, this ungrateful fool. What madness compelled $playerName to throw off Kanta's gift of protection, given so dearly?"
The crowd boos and jeers, calling for your blood to spill on the agrav plates, or to boil away in the vacuum as merciless as their queen. Cydonia looks pleased with himself. Kanta sits, impassive, respirators hissing like serpents coiled to strike.

[Line 9470] [Options Given: kpLeave2:Leave]

[Line 9471] Cydonia nods stiff-necked, the tiniest hint of a bow, then addresses you before the entire court.
"You've come crawling to her worshipfulness," he turns, projecting his piercing voice to all corners. "The mighty Warlord Kanta; the predator of the Persean Sector; the font of violence from which we quench our thirst for glory," then spins back toward you.
"Why are YOU here? Could you not protect your own outposts? Perhaps," he drops to almost a whisper, "it is something else."

[Line 9471] [Options Given: kpAudience2:Continue]

[Line 9472] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Captain $playerName! It is clear to me that you believe that all you do, from one end of the Sector to the other, is done in Kanta's name already!"
"Did you not claim to be working for our dear warlord?" The small man strains and sweats as he accuses you, "Did not her fear-inspiring name cross your lips... without her permission? Do you presume, captain, to know the will of our mighty-"
With the sound of grating metal, Cydonia's tirade is cut off. The Warlord Kanta stands up on armored mechanical legs. There's a thrashing, banging sound.

[Line 9472] [Options Given: kp_audienceBluffs2:Continue]

[Line 9473] [Option Selected: Continue]
Laughter. That's what it is. Kanta's laughter like autocannon shell-cases dropping from an ejection port. Metal on metal, industrialized murder.
"Your presumption amuses us," Kanta's amplified voice booms out over the court, drowning out all else. "So eager to serve us, are you? Then we will make use of you."
Cydonia's mouth is a flat, twitching line.

[Line 9473] [Options Given: kpAudience2:Continue]

[Line 9474] [Option Selected: Continue]
"You dare return here $playerName!" shouts the strange doctor. "You stole Zal from us! Her clever little tinkerer, her asset, her prize." 
He seethes, almost hyperventilating, "H-how dare you!"

"You dare return here $playerName!" shouts the strange doctor, "After attacking the citadel of our warlord! Her home, her family! You stole Zal from us! Her clever little tinkerer, her asset, her prize."

The court murmurs, heavy boots shuffle; you hear the distinct click-clank of a heavy kinetic round being chambered; it is inadvisable weapons handling practice within a sealed environment at the best of times. There is hatred among the pirates, you see, and Cydonia is stirring it against you.

[Line 9476] [Options Given: kpAudience2:Continue]

[Line 9477] [Option Selected: Continue]
Kanta's gauntlet slams against the side of her throne, crashing through the murmur of the court like thunder. Again she slams the throne, then once more, leaving only a painful echo.
Warlord Kanta speaks, like the voice of a heavy combat walker if it could speak, harmonics buzzing through your bones, "What tribute have you brought us? What gift will sate us?"
Cydonia leans in close, acidic breath wafting over you, "The warlord's protection is not easily gained. Do not offend her with unworthy dross," he hisses.

[Line 9479] [Options Given: kpGift100k:One hundred thousand credits]

[Line 9480] [Option Selected: One hundred thousand credits]
"Paltry, plebeian, pathetic," Cydonia hisses at you, "A beggar's sum, unworthy of the mighty Kanta!" he shouts, spittle flying.
The court shouts and jeers at your pitiable offer.

[Line 9481] [Options Given: kpGift1mil:One million credits]

[Line 9482] [Option Selected: One million credits]
"Hm," the doctor ponders, then looks to Kanta, whose obsidian gaze acknowledges him.
"One million credits," says Cydonia with an unusual affect, then adds "Dull, very dull. But a queenly sum nonetheless."

[Line 9483] [Options Given: kpLobster:A thousand units of Volturnian Lobster]

[Line 9484] [Option Selected: A thousand units of Volturnian Lobster]
"A thousand units of Andrada's best, how..." the doctor pauses, quickly glancing to the black eyes of Kanta for confirmation. 
"...delightful," Cydonia concludes as if he was going to say it all along. "It will bring pleasure to our warlord-queen to vex Andrada's customs ministry with the mystery of how so many of his cold-blooded spawn slithered from his grasp."
For her part, Kanta nods, apparently satisfied, though it is impossible to know through her mask of a face.

[Line 9486] [Option Selected: A $foundWeaponName, glorious engine of destruction]
"Oh, oh, th-" Cydonia almost bounces with excitement, but his mewling is crushed by Kanta's synthesized voice.
"A weapon of transcendent power," she booms. "A beautiful thing. THIS. Is a gift worthy of Kanta." Her dark eyes scan the crowds accusingly, demanding someone match this prize. None can.

"This, this bucket of bolts is unfit for the lowest scavenger following in a pirate's wake," Cydonia starts working himself into a lather. "-Let alone a Queen!"
Kanta stands with a clank and the doctor drops into a confused silence. Kanta's synthesized voice bursts like a roar: "Your cruelty is subtle, and impressive. It will please us to take Ibrahim's most treasured ship. We shall have it overhauled and used to plunder the weak. Each prize, each victory taken will wound her."
The artificial words drip with pleasure; it is an intimate view into Kanta's psyche, and her court shuffles uncomfortably. Cydonia stutters as he makes arrangements, clearly displeased.

"Ah, ah ah," Cydonia's throat makes an uncomfortable noise. "A truly unique specimen, a fitting trophy from Tri-Tachyon! Beautiful, my queen-"
"NO." Kanta's denial overwhelms Cydonia's mewling praise. "That," she booms, "Is a fool's prize. Desired beyond all reason by the factions, and others; it invites disaster from this world and those unknown."
She sits with finality, and her last words echo in the court-chamber, which has gone oddly quiet but for a wash of fearful susurration. Kanta is not much known for natural philosophy; her courtiers speculate at her implication.

[Line 9491] [Options Given: kpRemnantCap:The $foundShipName, a $foundShipClass]

[Line 9492] [Option Selected: The $foundShipName, a $foundShipClass]
"That? So garish, so useless," Cydonia sputters, "And expensive. It would require an AI-core and special technicians to keep working at all. Think of the expense, and-"
Kanta's voice rolls over Cydonia's whining like thunder: "Glorious!"
"It shall be a monument to Tri-Tachyon's betrayal," she booms, "And to Hegemony weakness. We shall display it proudly, and invite them to remove their shame. They will cringe in fear!" 

[Line 9492] [Options Given: kpLeaveProt:Continue]

[Line 9493] A Remnant capital ship, your gift to the pirate queen, has been hollowed of its valuable parts and crudely affixed to the exterior of Kanta's Den like a garish hunting trophy.

[Line 9494] [Options Given: kpDroneReplicator:A Domain-era Combat Drone Replicator]

[Line 9495] [Option Selected: A Domain-era Combat Drone Replicator]
The core of the drone replicator is dragged into the court on an agrav sled and the specs read aloud at Cydonia's instructions by some kind of lead technician.
Certain phrases stand out: "autonomous hunter-killer", "exploding-tip fragmentation", "semi-lethal crowd-control escalation",  "adjustable potency chemical irritant", "30,000 rounds-per-minute", "excruciating burning sensation".
Kanta nods along, seemingly enthralled. Cydonia glances between you and her, ensuring that he is following the lead of his queen.

[Line 9495] [Options Given: kpDroneReplicator2:Continue]

[Line 9496] [Option Selected: Continue]
As the reading is finished, Cydonia exchanges one last look with Kanta then turns approvingly to the technician. "Take it to The Arena!" he shouts, and Kanta's court erupts with thunderous shouts and stomps.

[Line 9498] [Option Selected: A Domain-era Dealmaker Holosuite, adaptable for medical experiments]
Kanta blasts her synthetic approval, "YES. A delightful toy for my Cydonia, for his little experiments, his playthings. Won't they amuse us?" With a creak of metal and clatter of beads and trophies, Kanta turns to look upon Cydonia. 
 
He seems to shrink, "Y- yes, my queen. I'm sure- I suppose it could be... repurposed for my needs. There will be less need for live... subjects, I suppose."
The 'doctor' looks crestfallen at this development. It would seem that Kanta doesn't notice, or care.

[Line 9499] [Options Given: kpCorruptedForge:A corrupted Domain-era Nanoforge]

[Line 9500] [Option Selected: A corrupted Domain-era Nanoforge]
"That?" Cydonia's face contorts into a seemingly impossible sneer. "You can find junk like that in half the ruins in the fringe systems alone! It's a lump of technological excrement passed by the dying idiot-corpse of the Domain!" 
Kanta looks on, impassive. Bored, almost, if her moods could be divined by the subtle shift and hum of her augments.

[Line 9501] [Options Given: kpPlanetkiller:A Domain-era Planetkiller]

[Line 9502] [Option Selected: A Domain-era Planetkiller]
Cydonia looks uncertain, glances at Kanta, then back to you. His mouth opens, and you hear a grinding, throbbing sound. It builds, louder. Laughter.
Kanta stands, laughing. Then stops; black eyes fixed on you. Cydonia and the court are frozen silent, awaiting her mercurial judgment.
"It is a beautiful thing you offer," she booms at you in synth-voice. "But a predator's weapon is not terracide. Keep it. And be pursued by small men dreaming dreams of death to the end of the Arm of Perseus."
Cydonia, and the court, bow at her judgment; murmuring.

[Line 9503] [Options Given: kpPristineForge:A pristine Domain-era Nanoforge, a true rarity]

[Line 9504] [Option Selected: A pristine Domain-era Nanoforge, a true rarity]
"I... I, yes, yes" Cydonia caresses the specifications you transmitted to his datapad. He capers around the grim totems surrounding Kanta's throne and excitedly shows her the screen. Her attention is, for a moment, laser-focused. Her court of pirates murmur and whisper.
Finally, Kanta's gauntleted hand, strength enhanced by cybernetics, shoves Cydonia away like a dewy-eyed lapdog. He nearly topples from the platform, but manages to recover his balance.
Kanta stands with a clank, the hum of her synthetic voice grows, a raw buzz, in anticipation of her proclamation.

[Line 9504] [Options Given: kpPristineForge2:Continue]

[Line 9505] [Option Selected: Continue]
"A worthy gift," her voice blasts. "The heart of Domain power - torn from the chest of the dead colossus, it will beat now for ME." Her words echo painfully off the metal panels of the chamber. 
"Great teeth it shall grow! Again will the Persean Sector learn true fear of the WARLORD."
The court erupts in cheers, and a chaos of stomping boots and pounding longarms resolves into a chant. "KAN-TA, KAN-TA". She revels in their praise, and their bloodlust.

[Line 9505] [Options Given: kpLeaveProt:Continue]

[Line 9506] Long-abandoned factory rings thrum with activity and glimmer with new construction. Fresh ship hulls are assembled, sharp ribs laid with armored plates and fit with weapons of war. Kanta has installed a pristine nanoforge here, and her family is making use of it.

[Line 9508] [Option Selected: An Orbital Fusion Lamp]
"What," Cydonia's lip curls into a sneer, "would the mighty warlord do with-" 
There's a heavy clank, all turn to find that Kanta is standing, trailing trophies and tubes. "WE ACCEPT," her vocoder blasts, the voice inhuman. "Vacuum AND fire shall greet those prisoners I wish to dispose."
The pirates of the court cheer to this, stomping their feet and slamming weapon-stocks into the deck plates.

Cydonia inspects the blueprint specifications on his datapad, pallid fingers caressing the display. "Hmm, mmm, yes."
He capers up Kanta's throne, dodging the twisted remains of hand weapons and morbid totems, to show the pirate queen your offering.
Kanta's cybernetic mask of a face does turn to look, and in but a moment her gauntleted arm whirrs and shoves Cydonia away like an annoying pet.

[Line 9513] [Option Selected: Continue]
She stands with the thrum of servos, sending Cydonia tumbling off the platform. Miraculously, he is not impaled on any of the jagged prizes which festoon the base of Kanta's throne.
"WE ACCEPT," she booms in a voice like a synthesized orbital strike, and raises a gauntleted fist.
"Install this in our arsenal. A new blade for our hunters, the Sector shall bleed rich and deep!"
The pirate court cheers, pounding the deckplates with boots and weapons.

Cydonia rolls his eyes theatrically as you declare your willingness to betray a contact at Kanta's will. "A worthless-" he begins.
A rhythmic thudding overpowers him, like the sound of a malfunctioning shield capacitor locked into a destructive charge cycle. You suppress your instinctual reaction to that danger as you realize that Kanta is laughing. Cydonia cringes, holding pallid hands over his ears.
With a dying echo, her laughter stops.

[Line 9516] [Option Selected: Continue]
She speaks with the voice of a mechanical demon, "A willing betrayer; most delectable. You understand that the softest weapon may cause the most pain."

Cydonia frowns petulantly through your declaration.
"A favor?" he calls out shrilly, "My mighty queen's protection for the feeble promise of a-"
A metallic boom and the electric hum of overcharged amplification drown out Cydonia's mockery. Kanta's voice is like thunder, echoing off the armored wall-panels of the court chamber. 
"WE ACCEPT."
With those simple words, she sits. Her face, a dark mask, has no expression you can discern. But she might be smiling to herself, somewhere inside her shell.

You step back from the center of the court-chamber, your time in the garish spotlight now finished.
Kanta's metal body hisses on her throne, patient as a landmine. Cydonia scuttles to speak with one or another pirate sergeant responsible for prisoners and petitioners awaiting Kanta's judgment.

[Line 9526] The comm-link flickers, freezes, and restarts as your comms protocols align with whatever the pirate is using.
The pirate $rank appears, a smug look already emplaced. "Captain $playerName. I am here on behalf of her mercilessness, Warlord Kanta. It is her wish that you know that her many eyes are watching you."
$HeOrShe smiles, displaying teeth filed to points. "That is all."

[Line 9532] [Option Selected: "No, there has to be some alternative." (decline)]
The pirate puts on a look of concern, probably false. "This is not a negotiation, captain. The Warlord demands blood and ruin, so it you will provide."
"It comes either from $affk_marketName, or from you," $heOrShe casually drops $hisOrHer datapad. "The choice is yours."

[Line 9533] [Option Selected: "Are you mad? Bombard $affk_marketName? It's suicide." (decline)]
The pirate looks amused. "There is not," $heOrShe shrugs with feigned calm. 
"What Kanta demands, Kanta gets. Our choice is whether to stand in the way of her rage - to what, prove something? It proves nothing. This is the way of the Persean Sector, captain."
"So," $heOrShe taps a short rhythm on $hisOrHer control console. "If it is suicide you think will result, then Kanta can provide your death just as well as some faction-navy. Choose."

Kanta's minion transfers you the relevant data to perform the operation: a cursory nav entry providing no useful tactical info, a quick skim tells you. Your approach is all up to you. It would definitely be prudent to launch the attack with your transponder off, for starters...
$HeOrShe bares $hisOrHer protruding diamond canines - a hot look among certain crowds, you're sure. "Remember to have fun," $heOrShe says, then cuts the link.

$HeOrShe leans in, "When that thirst awakens, you will provide her with what she demands." The pirate flashes a sharp-toothed smile, diamond canines flashing, "One way, or another."

[Line 9542] $marketName fills your bridge tactical display, a spatter of hollowed icons representing dead targets. The last one blinks out. This should make the Warlord Kanta happy, if she is even capable of that emotion anymore.
You wave a hand to collapse the tactical display, and it winks out obediently. The holomatrix snows then reforms a navigational overview, your $shipOrFleet holding station in the center.

[Line 9548] [Option Selected: "We have business to discuss."]
"So we do, so we do. It is pleasing that you've decided to be civilized about it," the pirate puts on a self-satisfied smile.
"The fringe is dangerous!" $heOrShe explains, "And my people hungry. I propose that you provide me with 10% of the gross income of your colony. I shall see that my compatriots, ah, protect your trade lanes and rein in the desperate scavengers who might feel enticed to raid for much-needed supplies."

[Line 9549] [Option Selected: "We have business to discuss."]
"So we do, so we do." The pirate does not smile. "And yet. You say 'business', but I'm no fool - I've heard of your treachery. Call me a pirate, but I rob and kill honestly."
$HeOrShe continues without considering $himOrHerself to have made any kind of contradiction, "I am also known for my forgiving moods. So I shall offer you a chance to repair your reputation: give me 10% of the gross income from your colony. My compatriots will protect your trade lanes and rein in the desperate scavengers who might feel enticed to raid for much-needed supplies."
$HeOrShe puts on a conciliatory grin.

[Line 9550] [Option Selected: "We have business to discuss."]
"Business? You're a liar, captain. I'd respect if you shot me in the back, but only if you did it honestly. This?" $HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head in disgust, apparently, at your duplicity.
"I'll not be your next fool. The only business there is to do between us will be done through ships of war."

[Line 9550] [Options Given: psk_acceptStory:"You'll have 10% of the gross income of my colonies and I'll tell you why you'll accept."

"Come now," $heOrShe says. "I respect that you... ended our previous, ah, agreement to my face. You aren't a coward, I'll give you that much."
$HeOrShe sighs, shaking $hisOrHer head. "Coward or not, you also aren't to be trusted." $HeOrShe spreads $hisOrHer hands, acting the thoughtful administrator. "I have people to care for. How can I do that if tomorrow you might come to me and tell me our deal is off? That's no way to deal."

[Line 9557] [Option Selected: "10 percent is too much. Be reasonable."]
"I'm afraid my compatriots will accept no less. In my position, I must... provide. A king who does not provide..." 
A note of legitimate worry seems to have entered $hisOrHer voice. $HeOrShe tries to cover it by re-asserting a smug smile, but it is half-hearted at best.
"Come now; as the king of a gang yourself - whatever you want to call it - you understand. We are all shackled in a great chain from high to low and low to high. The weak must pledge what strength they have to the powerful so that they are not crushed."

[Line 9557] [Options Given: psk_businessTooMuchReasonableA:"You justify piracy with that nonsense?"

$HeOrShe shrugs, smile wavering.

[Line 9560] [Option Selected: "So you're calling me powerful.";['psk_businessTooMuchReasonableB']]
"I, um." $HeOrShe realizes that $heOrShe has walked into a trap of $hisOrHer own making - and coughs, lamely.
"And possibly even among possible equals, each must contribute what they are best able, don't you agree? A few credits for protection, it's a fair trade."

[Line 9561] [Option Selected: "An outrageous demand! You can see the power of my $shipOrFleet from where you sit."]
"And an admirable fleet it is," $heOrShe admits, giving a moment of dainty applause. "But greater empires than yours have sent fleets to sweep away the rubbish, yes?"
$HeOrShe leans closer to the comm-interface, smile gone. "Believe me, captain, I have no desire for this to come to a fight. My crews... they have expectations. If I do not meet them, they will toss me out the airlock and find someone who will."
$HeOrShe sits back. "Heavy is the crown," $heOrShe mutters grimly.

[Line 9562] [Option Selected: "You'll have 10% of the gross income of my colonies and I'll tell you why you'll accept."]
The pirate snorts and crosses $hisOrHer arms. "Listening."
You pull up the report prepared by your quartermaster and begin reading the executive summary, taking care to enunciate the large numbers describing the credits moving through your properties.
It takes little to inflame the pirate's greed. You pause dramatically and look over your TriPad; $personName licks $hisOrHer lips and says "You have yourself a deal."

The pirate pulls a bottle of something from behind $hisOrHer comms console, and lifts it up.
"To our mutual betterment!" $heOrShe declares, then takes a long glug. $HeOrShe slams the bottle on the console, and wipes $hisOrHer mouth with $hisOrHer sleeve, not quite suppressing a belch.

"Oh!" $HeOrShe actually jumps a bit with the shock of your pronouncement, but quickly tries to play it cool. "More's the pity. This'll be a black mark on my otherwise perfect day. But," $heOrShe shrugs, "I get it. Gotta look out for number one. If you don't, you look like easy prey."
$HeOrShe thumps $hisOrHer chest, almost managing to hide the tremble in $hisOrHer hands. "Point made, message received. Now, will you reconsider?"

"Wisely done, captain." $HeOrShe tries to conceal $hisOrHer relief. "Why fight when our arrangement means we can each spend more time enjoying the better things in life?"
$HeOrShe flicks a grubby bottle of something stashed beside the comms console, making a distinct 'ting' sound.

[Line 9570] [Option Selected: "It's over. Don't make me repeat myself."]
$HeOrShe goes still. "I, I think we understand one another, $playerName."

$HeOrShe raises $hisOrHer chin another couple degrees, "As the apparent representative of a non-League entity and non-signatory to the Persean Sector commercial standards accord, you are hereby ordered to stand down your weapons. Prepare to be boarded."

The inspection teams are not gentle, tearing open hatches, rummaging through carefully organized stocks, and running active scans directly through sensitive equipment clusters.
Complaints from your $shipOrFleet's officers are met by stony bureaucratic obfuscation. "Claim forms may be submitted to seek recompense for 'regrettably unavoidable' damage incurred during inspection", but "one shouldn't expect a response from the investigatory body for at least a cycle".

"Do you have something to hide?" $HisOrHer tone grows dismissive, "Captain."
"Attempting to avoid a legitimate commerce regulation inspection per interfactional law is highly suspicious. Is it drugs? Illegally harvested organs? We'll find out."
The League $Post speaks aside, "Prepare the boarding parties. Give orders to be especially... thorough. We're dealing with some prime space-scum."

[Line 9585] [Option Selected: "With that fleet? You're in no position to make demands."]
The League $Post's face freezes for a moment. Then $heOrShe speaks.
"You seem like an upstanding independent operator." $HeOrShe nods, the very image of reasonable authority. "I'm going to let you go with a warning. There are some bad folks out here, captain. Someone has to keep them in line."

A smile actually breaks across the League $Post's face. "I had a good feeling about you, captain. I must apologize for my... assertive words. As an independent authority yourself, I am sure you understand fully the need to stand up to those factions which would trample our rights in the name of some dead empire or backward religion."
$HeOrShe gives some hand-signal to someone off-image. "You're free to go, of course. You'll find the shipyards of Kazeron an excellent place to refit and replenish. There's no finer works in the Sector, if you ask me."

$HeOrShe fixes you with a glare as $heOrShe addresses someone off-image, "Lieutenant, have the boarding parties prepared. We're going to be extra thorough with this one."

"Perhaps they haven't yet filed the report with command," $heOrShe says, airily. "With so many bandits and smugglers, there's little time to catch up with the bureaucracy."
"So I'm sure you'll understand that I must proceed with the inspection." A chilly hint of a smile, a challenge, grows on $hisOrHer face. "Standard procedure."

"You've proven yourself an oathbreaker twice over," the Persean League $post says, derision plain in $hisOrHer voice. $HeOrShe turns to address $hisOrHer own crew and officers, "Witness the fate of an upstart bandit who assaults the principles of the League!"
$HisOrHer hand drops, signaling the comms cutoff before you can reply.

"Independent $shipOrFleet cap- er, colonial leader. Please accept greetings on behalf of the Persean League - and my personal assurance that we seek only to secure our shared rights and freedoms."
An uncomfortable pause, then "I've not been authorized to negotiate on behalf of this League operation. You will have to speak with the Prime Navarch of the Grand Armada."
$HeOrShe moves to hit the comms shut-off.

[Line 9598] The comms hang for a moment on the crest of the League then snaps to a stately-looking League $Post.
"Independent colonial leader, Captain $PlayerName. Greetings from the Persean League." The hint of a smile forms on $hisOrHer face.

"Gladly. It is the aim of the Persean League to form a confederation which upholds the rights and freedoms of each member polity." 
$HeOrShe raises $hisOrHer eyes up toward some ideal form which exists in an imagined space. "Together, united in strength, we stand against tin-pot tyrants, fanatics, and mega-corps alike." 
$Post $personLastName drops $hisOrHer gaze back to your image. "Otherwise, independent polities get peeled away and... eaten. Devoured directly less often in recent cycles, but eaten away from the inside nonetheless by infiltration and corruption."

"I'm here to do you a favor, $playerName. And your people. Remember Mairaath. Remember Opis. It's only together, united, that we have a chance to stand against tin-pot tyrants, fanatics, and mega-corps." 
"Independents who raise their heads too high? They get burned. Our strength is what stops them. The League is the best of all futures, one worth fighting for."

The hint of smile disappears like a wisp of vapor in a star's low orbit.
"I'm here to do you a favor, captain," $heOrShe uses the minor fleet-officer title like a slur. "Mairaath. Opis," $heOrShe spits the words with anger.
"Independents who raise their heads too high? They get burned by the tyrant remains of dead empires or their pet fanatics. And the only thing stopping that from happening again is our combined strength."

[Line 9611] [Option Selected: Explain where Reynard Hannan can stick the League Armada]
$Post $personLastName sits patiently as you speak.
"Very imaginative, captain," $heOrShe says once you finish. "You've made your position quite clear."

[Line 9612] [Option Selected: "This is piracy! You can't just blockade any system you want!"]
"This," the $post paces, hands behind $hisOrHer back, "is a standard commerce protection operation performed by an interstellar confederation of peace-seeking polities which are, collectively, recognized by interfactional treaty."
$HeOrShe turns to face the comms. "Are you such an entity? Or are you an upstart whose treasures are simply floating in space, waiting to be plucked?"

$HeOrShe rolls $hisOrHer eyes. "How nice for you," $heOrShe spits.
"Let me explain the sector, captain -- and it's a mere captain you'll remain if you don't understand this -- freedom and rights exist within civilization; a social construct. You may choose to be part of our society, or you may embrace the consequences of barbarism."

Reynard lips move into a small, cold smile, as if indulging a joke made in very poor taste.
"Your word is nothing, $playerName; a wisp of a forgotten memory, lost between the stars. And you come to me and bark like a lap-hound, begging but not understanding."
If his look didn't contain such contempt, you'd think he was pitying you.

"Do you remember what we had, $playerName?" Reynard looks dreamily away, "A shared vision, my patronage, a future. Together."
He turns an icy gaze back on you, like the target-lock of a directed energy submunition. "Do you remember throwing that away, like so much effluent?"
"I remember." His expression is very still.

[Line 9635] [Option Selected: "Go on..."]
He explains that you must hold a League commission, and pay $plDuesPercent of gross colony income in dues. In turn, the Persean League will provide you with political protection from the sort of meddling major factions use to bully minor polities; Hegemony AI inspections, for instance. You will benefit from various League development programs for new member-polities which should increase colony accessibility by around 10%.
"Provide the League with dues and commercial access and you will be free to run your affairs as you wish," he concludes. "Barring certain extremes which would embarrass the League, naturally." He gives you a look of self-aware pedantry, "But any leader with sense knows how to keep their internal affairs... internal."

[Line 9636] "You are already commissioned with the League," he says approvingly. "This would do much to ease the membership process."

[Line 9637] "You presently hold a $otherCommissionFaction commission," he says, frowning. "A problem, but not insurmountable. Resign that commission and commit to the Persean League as part of the membership agreement."
"Certain members of the council may object, perhaps loudly. But they'll merely be seeking concessions." Reynard gives a small smile, "Routine matters, easily managed."

[Line 9638] "You hold no major faction's commission," he says, eyes focused on a subtle interface implant. "Considering your... activities, you will need to commit to a Persean League commission as a part of the membership agreement; a standard arrangement."

You explain that your main objection is the cost of the membership dues; paying for League membership simply won't do.

"Well," Reynard's tone contains just a hint of impatience. "The standard terms of Persean League membership stand, as I've explained."
You must hold a Persean League commission. You will be required to pay $plDuesPercent of gross colony income in dues.

"Oh, that was you?" Reynard's facade of carefree loftiness looks increasingly brittle.
"The forges will provide, no doubt. No doubt... " His expression slackens as he ponders something. Then he quirks his lip, a sneer like a cornered wolf. "The League Council will respect your demonstration, no doubt about it."
"I must admit you're not only clever, but lucky," he says, trying his best to concede very little. "You've proven that to my satisfaction. Admirable qualities in... an associate."

[Line 9649] [Option Selected: "I defeated your punitive expedition. You've tried to use direct force against me and failed."]
"An unfortunate business." He puts on an almost regretful look, "And a waste of key resources. Naturally, I had to appear to follow the voice of the League Council on that matter."
"You've founded a powerful polity." His hands open wide, generous. "I could see that from the start, of course. But what's important is that you proved it to the entire council. We can use this."
He smiles, conceding nothing.

"It is the relationships formed between the tiers of our civilization, the flow of loyalty and favor, that ties our interests together and benefits us all," Reynard muses. 
He closes his eyes for a moment, holding his hands together against his chest, "I would be honored to offer patronage to you on such terms."
"We'll have to spin this arrangement to the public, somehow, of course. Some lesser polity inevitably cries 'bribery' - such a crude word - in order to leverage unearned influence."

[Line 9651] [Option Selected: "Perhaps a $hannanBribePercent fee directly to Gens Hannan accounts, for facilitating this agreement?"]
"It is the relationships formed between the tiers of our civilization, the flow of loyalty and favor, that ties our interests together and benefits us all," Reynard muses. 
He closes his eyes for a moment as he holds and slowly releases a deep breath. They open suddenly. "Your reputation, however, precedes you, $playerName. You've made a habit of breaking your word, and I cannot offer my patronage to someone with no honor."
"I mean no insult, of course," he says, magnanimous in his own way. "People of your, ah, ruthless quality have their use. Just not like this."

[Line 9652] [Option Selected: "Rumor is Kazeron's pristine nanoforge is... missing. I would donate a spare I happen to have."]
A strained grimace appears on Reynard Hannan's face, showing new wrinkles where they aren't meant to appear.
"The... rumors, unfortunately, are true. An ugly business, the details of which we need not revisit." His impressive jawline clenches tightly for a moment.
"For your part in quietly returning the forge of Kazeron to its former glory, I would personally ensure that the League Council fully appreciates your... patriotism."

"Let me be the first, then, to welcome you to the Persean League, $playerName. Together we will build a worthy future for the Persean Sector and, one day, the galaxy itself."

Text for above, when talking to Reynard Hannan
------------------------------
[Line 9685] "These words come as a surprise, $playerName," Reynard Hannan says calmly. "Would you throw away what we have built together so needlessly and so thoughtlessly?"
 
You detect the anger boiling, deeply. "You had such potential."
He pulls back suddenly, turning away with a dismissive flick. "Tell me now that you misspoke. I will allow myself to forget your slip of the tongue."

[Line 9686] "These words come as a surprise, $playerName," Reynard Hannan says calmly. "Would you violate the promise you made to me, and to Gens Hannan, so thoughtlessly? I imagined we would prosper together; build a new Persean Sector... together."
 
You detect the anger boiling, deeply. "I never took you for an oathbreaker," he says soft, and deadly.
He pulls back suddenly, turning away with a dismissive flick. "Tell me now that you misspoke. I will allow myself to forget your slip of the tongue."

[Line 9687] "Ingrate," Reynard Hannan spits the word. "I would see my League punish your barbarism, your bloody-minded fickleness, your oathbreaking."
"I would see your fleets smashed; your legacy burned to ash," he hisses, eyes afire. "Picture it, captain. You would be nothing but a dreary footnote in the history of the League, and minor embarrassment to Gens Hannan."
"If... you said such words, that would be your fate." He speaks very softly now, "Total annihilation."

[Line 9688] "Ingrate," Reynard Hannan spits the word. "My League remembers barbarism, bloody-minded fickleness, oathbreaking and lies. We remember Mairaath."
"One day," his eyes go cold as the space between the stars, "You might be only dust. Annihilated, forgotten. You could be nothing but a dreary footnote in the glorious history of the League, a minor embarrassment to Gens Hannan."
"Picture it," he says softly. "After such words, that would be your fate."

[Line 9689] Reynard closes his eyes for a moment, "You've made a series of terrible errors, $playerName," he says, voice filled with mock-sorrow. "You had such potential. To be part of something greater; to build something lasting, something beautiful."
The calm breaks, "Churl!" he shouts, eyes afire. "You're nothing but a barbarian, good for nothing but chaos! I'll grind your fleets to dust! I'll raze your industry to the ground! Your treasures will become as so much slag; your people scattered to the vacuum to pollute some other world, or die in the vacuum."
"When we come for you," his eyes are filled with hate, "We will come with fire."

[Line 9690] Reynard closes his eyes for a moment, "You've made a series of terrible errors, $playerName," he says, voice filled with mock-sorrow. "You had such potential. To be part of something greater; to build something lasting, something beautiful."
"Again and again you chose chaos. A barbarian-led rogue polity like yours... will never be allowed to rejoin the League."
"Don't worry about another blockade, captain," he spits the low title, his eyes shining like the frost of a cryopod. "Someday, we will come for you. And when we come, we will come with fire."

[Line 9691] "Ah. That's what I thought," Reynard says with false grace. "It sounds just like the sort of boorish faux pas you would make."

[Line 9694] [Option Selected: "I'd like to talk to you about joining the Persean League."]
"I see, I see," $heOrShe puts $hisOrHer hands together, considering $hisOrHer next words.
"There's an official process. Find a sponsor, send a delegation to meet the League Council, a question period, a vote." $HisOrHer eyes turn to you now, somehow meeting yours through the comms. "But what you're going to want to do is talk to Reynard Hannan. Nothing will move through the League Council unless Gens Hannan allows it." $HisOrHer eyes turn away again, and $heOrShe gives a small shrug.
"Welcome to Kazeron."

Stopping payments to Gens Hannan without leaving the League

[Line 9699] [Option Selected: "I'm stopping the payments to Gens Hannan, effective immediately."]
"Oh? If you're facing bankruptcy, I could have a word with some investors. As a personal favor, of course." He oozes noblesse oblige, reflecting on your situation.
Then a reasonable yet concerned look comes over him. "I understand now - you wish to avoid appearing as though you must beg. Perhaps my people could set up some kind of arrears system? Quietly, of course. No outsiders need know of your troubles."
He smiles.

[Line 9699] [Options Given: rh_confirmNoPay:"I'm not asking for help. I'm telling you the payments end. Now."
rh_abortNoPay:"Never mind, I've reconsidered."]

[Line 9700] [Option Selected: "Never mind, I've reconsidered."]
"Of course; I assumed you had misspoken." He looks casually aside, taking in what is no doubt a spectacular view. 
"It is the sort of thing you might do, and which I, of course, forgive."

[Line 9701] [Option Selected: "I'm not asking for help. I'm telling you the payments end. Now."]
Reynard's eyebrows raise by perhaps half a centimeter at your display.
"You could have been a client of greatness." He leans back, expression very cold. "It saddens me to find that you are either more a fool than I imagined, or that you do not fully comprehend the consequences of crossing Gens Hannan."
"Now I shall have to make a... demonstration of you."

[Line 9705] [Option Selected: "My decision to stop payments to Gens Hannan may have been ill-considered."]
"Poor thing." Reynard smiles sadly, the facade of forgiveness written across his face. "I hope you've learned your lesson."
He drops the expression for steely indifference. "Understand full and well that you're only going to get this one chance to cross me and return."

[Line 9705] [Options Given: rh_confirmPayAgain:"Yes, I made a terrible mistake. Please accept my apologies." 
rh_abortPayAgain:"Never mind, I didn't come here to beg."]

Reynard sighs, rolling his eyes.

[Line 9707] [Option Selected: "Yes, I made a terrible mistake. Please accept my apologies."]
"Treasure my forgiveness, captain. It is a rare and precious gift." He stares down, somehow, through the comms; imperious.
"Uphold your end of our arrangement, or your earlier problems will seem like a walk in the parks of Gilead."

[Line 9707] [Options Given: cutCommLinkPolite:End the conversation]

Various refusals to accept payment again

[Line 9709] [Option Selected: "My decision to stop payments to Gens Hannan may have been ill-considered."]
"Recall my words, captain. You had one chance for forgiveness," he says grimly, "and you wasted it."
"Do not recall to me your betrayal."

[Line 9710] [Option Selected: "My decision to stop payments to Gens Hannan may have been ill-considered."]
"There is a stain on you, captain," he says gravely. "It is the reek of one who does not keep their word. Lies I can forgive as mere intrigue... but to betray an oath?"
His head shakes, slowly. "Worse than dishonorable, it is uncivilized. You're a barbarian, captain. You cannot be a part of the world I've built."
"Don't misunderstand me," he stops, and fixing his gaze on you. "Barbarians have their use, nonetheless."

[Line 9711] [Option Selected: "My decision to stop payments to Gens Hannan may have been ill-considered."]
"Your little scrap of a colony - what was it called? I forget - is not a member of the Persean League, captain. What need have I to be patron to barbarians?"
He sighs, looking away. "I grant that mercs like you have their uses. But it always feels like one must sanitize after such transactions."

[Line 9712] [Option Selected: "My decision to stop payments to Gens Hannan may have been ill-considered."]
"No."
Reynard leans back, hands coming together in front of him. His lack of explanation is quite intentional, and it feels like acknowledging it would concede him a minor victory.

Bounty hunter sent as a result of GensHannanMachinations, requires stopping payments to Gens Hannan *twice*

[Line 9715] The connection flashes valid, and the merc captain appears before you, hands steepled.
"$playerName." $HeOrShe has an open, neutral expression. "When you become a client of the gens, you make an agreement.  If you fail to uphold your end of that agreement, I am paid to make you into an example of what happens to people who do not respect Gens Hannan."
$HeOrShe waits a moment, then adds apologetically, "The terms of my contract require that I tell you this. I will be attacking you now, I suggest you order combat stations." $HeOrShe reaches for the comms cut-off.

"If you have business matters to discuss, please contact Operations Command."
"And on behalf of Tactistar," $heOrShe adds, "I would like to wish you a very safe day."

[Line 9724] "Acknowledging contact with hostile $shipOrFleet," the $post says grimly.
"Be advised that the operating protocols of this detachment do not preclude hostile action against your $shipOrFleet," $heOrShe says. It's a jurisprudent threat, but one nonetheless implied.

[Line 9724] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 9726] "Tacticstar Operational Command Fleet acknowledging," the $post looks to a display, "$ShipOrFleet of Captain $playerName."
$HeOrShe raises $hisOrHer eyebrows, "I will note, for your benefit, that your ident is included within our operational contract. Now I don't make a habit of discussing contractual fulfillment details with the, ah, target. But."
The Tactistar $post stops before making you some kind of offer - this would presumably be against the terms of $hisOrHer contract - but $heOrShe does look like $heOrShe expects some kind of offer.

[Line 9727] "Tacticstar Operational Command Fleet acknowledging," the $post looks to a display, "$ShipOrFleet of Captain $playerName."
$HeOrShe raises $hisOrHer eyebrows, "Your profile is included within the scope of our contract. I am forbidden from discussing contract details with, ah, project success targets. But be advised that Tactistar will pursue hostile action against you and your $shipOrFleet for the duration of our private operational bond."
The Tactistar $post is all business, cold as the void; you're just a project goal to $himOrHer.

"Captain, captain!" $HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head in a pretense of shock, "My word is my bond. Besides, Tactistar holds a contract! A contract which includes a generous signing payment."
"Where would we be if mercenaries could simply sell their services to the highest bidder, with no regard for such concepts as honor and, after a fashion, morality?" $HeOrShe gestures vaguely, "Just imagine the sort of world we would live in."
$HeOrShe looks off into space for a few seconds, as if lost in a daydream. $HeOrShe turns back to face you, expression perfectly earnest. "No, your offer simply will not do."

[Line 9740] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 9741] "$PlayerName, is it? Ah- ah ah," $heOrShe makes a strange stuttering sound. You're not sure if it's a laugh, or vacuum-damaged lungs. 
"Consider me s-so delighted to meet our s-source of plunder." The $post sits there with an odd smile, eyes large. $HeOrShe seems content to simply look at you.

[Line 9742] [Option Selected: "Not necessary. I've reached an understanding with Tri-Tachyon."]
"Oh- ah ah, is that s-so?" $HeOrShe looks almost hurt, eyes twitching as they access an implanted interface.
"N-no, there is-is nothing here about the bounty being canceled. My ah ah employer would never make this kind of error."
"S-so s-sorry captain, you will s-still have to s... die."
$HisOrHer eyes move in an odd half-arc, presumably disabling safety locks on combat systems, judging by your tactical officer's reaction in your peripheral vision.

[Line 9742] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 9743] The link flickers and stabilizes, mostly.
$HeOrShe stares at you for a moment, expressionless. Then speaks. "I'm afraid that conversation will serve no purpose here, $PlayerName."
An audio-visual warble lingers, never quite caught by the comms software. 

[Line 9744] [Option Selected: "Not necessary. I've reached an understanding with Tri-Tachyon."]
Only $hisOrHer eyes move, a reptilian flicker to an auxiliary display, then back to you. It occurs to you that they haven't yet blinked.
"Your words are irrelevant. Only a recall order coded with the keys I've exchanged with my Tri-Tachyon contact would suffice. Failing that, the contract stands."
A wash of distortion ripples across the display.
"Terminating comms," $heOrShe says.

[Line 9744] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 9745] The comms crackle slowly into a stable link.
"Blessed day, my friend!" $HeOrShe smiles widely, then reconsiders. "But perhaps not so much for you?"
The $post rustles around in some junk on $hisOrHer console, out of sight of the comms, then examines a beat-up datapad. "Knew it! By the holy stars in Ludd's commode, it's $playerName!" 
"Shall we pray together before getting on with it?"

[Line 9746] [Option Selected: "Not necessary. I've reached an understanding with Tri-Tachyon."]
"Oh then I must be the High Hegemon!" $HeOrShe laughs. "But, forgive me, forgive me - it's a virtue, you know; forgiveness," $heOrShe says. "I'll check."
The $post turns and shouts, "Peregrine, anything in the comms log about a contract recall?"
$HeOrShe looks back at the comms for a quick second to give you a skeptical smirk, then seems to listen carefully. There's some kind of shouted reply, impossible to make out through the crackle of the comms hardware.

[Line 9746] [Options Given: ttcrBH_butDerelict2:"Well?"]

[Line 9747] [Option Selected: "Well?"]
"Bad news."
$HeOrShe shrugs, "For you, anyway. I'll say a prayer once it's over, and I'll make it quick. Why, by next shift you'll be sipping tea with Ludd and the holy Pneuma! I'm almost jealous."
$HeOrShe stretches, then sits back upright. "Let's to it, shall we?" 

[Line 9747] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

[Line 9748] [Option Selected: "How could you attack a $playerBrotherOrSister of the Faith?"]
 $HeOrShe isn't even taken aback. "For a large enough bounty, of course!"
"I have a family, $playerBrotherOrSister. A very large family. And think of the good works! Mammon's lucre does much to soothe such suffering."
$PersonName puts $hisOrHer hands together piously, "I think - no, I have faith! - Ludd will understand." $HeOrShe closes $hisOrHer eyes to mutter a prayer through a beatific smile.

"I'm sorry," $Post $personLastName says, "but you appear to be engaged in a state of overt hostility with the Tri-Tachyon Corporation."
"Corporate guidelines expressly forbid official negotiation with polities, corporations, and entities which are actively engaged in destructive acts against Company property and human resources." 
$HeOrShe produces an insincere smile.

[Line 9757] [Option Selected: "I'd like to discuss the possibility of a deal to solve my ongoing 'friction' with Tri-Tachyon."]
"Really?" Arroyo's tone is irritated. "You're in the middle of a declared open war with Tri-Tachyon and you expect them to listen to some clever little deal I bring to them on your behalf?" 
"Star above," he shakes his head almost disbelieving. "The PR hit alone..." 

[Line 9758] [Option Selected: "I'd like to discuss the possibility of a deal to solve my ongoing 'friction' with Tri-Tachyon."]
"Really?" Arroyo looks irritated. "First things first: you don't call me 'Rayan'."
"Second, how can you possibly believe it would be that simple? You're in the middle of a declared open war with Tri-Tachyon. They aren't going to simply cut a deal with you through me." 
He shakes his head. "Just imagine. The PR would be terrible."

[Line 9759] [Option Selected: "I'd like to discuss the possibility of a deal to solve my ongoing 'friction' with Tri-Tachyon."]
"I'm sorry," $Post $personLastName says, "I'm afraid I can't help you with that request. I must also inform you that Company guidelines require that I report this conversation to my superior; I'm sure they will... take care of you."
$HeOrShe produces an insincere smile.

[Line 9760] [Option Selected: "I'd like to discuss the possibility of a deal to solve my ongoing 'friction' with Tri-Tachyon."]
"No," he says.
Arroyo doesn't quite smile, but seems somehow satisfied with himself.

[Line 9761] [Option Selected: "I'd like to discuss the possibility of a deal to solve my ongoing 'friction' with Tri-Tachyon."]
"Ah," $HeOrShe begins. "Your proposal is intriguing. The trouble is...  hmm." $HeOrShe thinks for a moment.
"I'd like to help you, I really would. However it is my sincerely held belief that bringing this proposal to my superiors is substantially more likely to impede my career than promote it."
"I'm sure you both understand and empathize with my predicament." $HeOrShe shrugs as if apologizing.

[Line 9762] [Option Selected: "I'd like to discuss the possibility of a deal to solve my ongoing 'friction' with Tri-Tachyon."]
You explain your perspective on the situation, and the Tri-Tachyon $Post nods along, nothing seeming to come as a surprise.
"I see you, I hear you, and I believe that together we can solve this misunderstanding," $heOrShe says, voice warmed by client-relations protocol training. $HeOrShe shifts to an apologetic look, "Of course I wouldn't want you to think that I was behind any of this. Tri-Tachyon is a big believer in healthy internal competition, and some executives become... overenthusiastic." $HeOrShe shakes her head, "Terribly misjudged and disrespectful of the business relationship you and I have built together." 
$HisOrHer contenance shifts seamlessly to negotiation-mode, "So if you'll allow me to walk you through a modest proposal..."

[Line 9762] [Options Given: ttMakeDeal2:Review the proposal]

[Line 9763] [Option Selected: "I'd like to discuss the possibility of a deal to solve my ongoing 'friction' with Tri-Tachyon."]
You explain your perspective on the situation. The Tri-Tachyon $Post looks, if anything, more and more skeptical.
"What we have is a bit of a 'trust gap'. You've broken some very important agreements made with various parties. This complicates the pitch. But I do believe that we can downplay this misunderstanding," $heOrShe explains, voice warmed by client-relations protocol training.
"The Tri-Tachyon corporation has working experience with post-crisis PR difficulties, and I suspect that certain executives could be persuaded to come to an understanding about your past actions." $HeOrShe smiles brightly. "After all, one of our core values is 'thinking outside the box'."
$HisOrHer contenance shifts seamlessly to negotiation-mode, "So if you'll allow me to walk you through a modest proposal..."

"'Cartel' is such an unpleasant word," $heOrShe says. "I prefer - and Marketing agrees with this - to think of our proposal to you as a strategic partnership which will enhance Tri-Tachyon shareholder value, increase customer satisfaction, and," $heOrShe smiles hungrily, "make us both a lot of credits."

"Hm," Arroyo leans back, thoughtful.
"First," he says. "You don't call me 'Rayan'."
He drums his fingers on his onyx desk, thinking. "There may be a way to make this work," he says speculatively. "Tri-Tachyon believes in internal competition, and if the reports I'm reading are any indication, the senior execs behind your 'friction' have somewhat overplayed their hand. The Financial Predictor section is seeing a lot of red coming up despite their best efforts to cover it up, and that means blood will spill."
"Figuratively, of course." A fierce smile begins to grow on Rayan's face. "Unless... well, let's talk details."

"First order of business," Arroyo says. "You don't call me 'Rayan'."
"Second, you must think pretty highly of yourself to think you've got a chance after the agreements you've broken." He drums his fingers on his onyx desk, considering your reputation perhaps, then stops.
"There may be a way to play this," he says. "Tri-Tachyon believes in internal competition, and if the reports I'm reading are any indication, the senior execs behind your 'friction' have somewhat overplayed their hand. The Financial Predictor array is seeing a lot of red coming up despite their best efforts to cover it up, and that means blood will spill."

Arroyo pulls up a shared document context and rapidly assembles a package of terms to present to his contacts at the highest levels of Tri-Tachyon: Data-sharing of certain nav charts and commodity futures projections, mutual safety protocols for trade fleets, shared field and in-dock servicing arrangements. 
What it amounts to is increased accessibility for your colonies' proportional to their market size. And, in turn, proportional gains to Tri-Tachyon's trade access.
"It's not exactly a cartel, but it's a good first step," Rayan says. "You both gain opportunities and, of course," his smile returns, "I get my percentage for arranging the deal while cutting down a few upjumped vac-heads in the executive corps. Win-win-win."
He leans back, admiring his work. "It's a good deal, $playerName. I suggest you take it."

$HeOrShe drops the smile. "Though I must emphasize that any condolence I offer is purely in the interest of generalized emotional support and should not be taken as a legally binding admission of guilt to any activities deemed illegal under the Persean Sector Commercial Standards Accord. Due to the nature of your implied accusation, company protocol does not allow me to engage in further discussion of the matter."

Talking to Arroyo, asking about how to approach dealing with Tri-Tachyon (this is pre-counter-raiding)

[Line 9776] [Option Selected: "So I've attracted the, ah, 'attention' of Tri-Tachyon."]
"I should charge you for this sort of thing," Arroyo says. "Expert advice; consulting fee, executive rate. Hm," he ponders for a moment.
"Senior executive rate."
Then he sighs and looks away - perhaps at the splendid view from his private chalet in the mountains of Eochu Bres.

"I wonder, sometimes. Most problems, I solve them by ordering an underling, a contractor, to go do what they do. They take the credits and disappear. Maybe it's solved, maybe they hide the most overt consequences. Whatever - it becomes not my problem. It's easy."
"Then you come along."

[Line 9777] [Options Given: ttArroyoProblems2a:"I come along?"

"Shut up," he says.
"You bring problems into my life. Annoying problems produced by your own blundering bloody-mindedness. You're vexing. You vex me. It's almost..."
He trails off, lost of his usual bluster.

[Line 9784] [Option Selected: "..."]
"Here's what you're going to do." He speaks loudly now, looking directly through the comms.
"This is a negotiation, you understand? Tri-Tachyon is making an assertive opening bid, they're saying 'Don't try to compete with us, you'll lose. Just give up.' If you want to be taken seriously, you must reply aggressively, you understand? Tell them that it is unprofitable to compete with YOU."
He slaps his hands down on his desk for emphasis, the clap of a starship reactor breach slamming against shields and inertial compensators. A bomb in the heart of a spaceport fuel hub set by a covert raid-squad.

[Line 9785] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Tri-Tachyon doesn't want war, they want a deal. They don't hold grudges, they don't care about ideology, or beliefs, or ethics. The Company is as happy to sell to the Church as the Diktat, and the Hegemony after two major wars, for all that those matter. In the end, it's about profits."
"So you must learn what negotiating is. You're not in this to destroy the Company; you can't. You don't want to remove their path to de-escalation. Show them that sponsoring attacks on you is a poor investment, but don't make it a PR disaster - it must be a covert fight. Transponder off, you hear me? Burn their fleets, burn their facilities, and always make sure they can say it wasn't you. Give them an out, and that out will be cutting a nice deal with you."
"Win-win."
He pauses to look accusingly at you. "Are my words getting into your brain or has it been floating around in space too long? Do you understand win-win?"

He strokes his beard and consults a datapad.

[Line 9787] [Option Selected: "I understand. Fight covertly, cut a deal. Win-win." (lie)]
Arroyo narrows his eyes at your lie.
"I'm not telling you to like it," he says. "I'm telling you how to get it done. Play this right and we can both make a killing."
A pause, then he smirks. "You know what I mean."

[Line 9788] [Option Selected: "I cannot let their trespasses go unanswered; it would be dishonorable."]
"Hopeless," he says, rolling his eyes.
"Might as well join the Hegemony officer corps and take up knife fighting. They love getting themselves killed over fool-notions."

He doesn't seem to want to talk about honor.

[Line 9797] [Option Selected: "You describe piracy, banditry, and might-makes-right. What of interfactional law?"]
"What of it?" he says, exasperated, then catches himself. "No, don't give me a speech about law. I don't care, and no one else cares. Just stop."
"I should have charged you that executive consulting fee," he mutters.

[Line 9798] [Option Selected: "Why can't we just talk it out and make a deal? Why all the killing?"]
"Hopeless," he says, exasperated. "Did you hear a word I said? I can't believe I called this 'fun'."

[Line 9803] "We Knights of Ludd greet you; blessed are we to be serving as guardians of the Faithful of this volume who cannot protect themselves."
"Pray us that you come here to assist... in your way." There's a just-detectable quaver in the $post's voice. $HeOrShe perhaps realizes that the Knights are somewhat overstepping their rights here.

[Line 9814] [Option Selected: "Cut the posturing. You're using your stray believers as an excuse to attack my operation."]
The Knight appears to be taken aback. "Only an unbeliever could be so godlessly cynical," $heOrShe exclaims, looking at you with a mix of pity and disgust.
"I will pray for you, captain," $heOrShe says, recovering $hisOrHer composition. "After you give us your tithe."

[Line 9815] [Option Selected: "But $brotherOrSister, surely you know that I bear a commission of the Church..."]
"Ah, uh." The $post looks uncomfortable, glancing aside as a subordinate whispers a confirmation to $himOrHer.
"...Of course, yes. We are blessed that you walk with us. Given your commitment to the Mother Church, surely you understand the necessity of the tithe."

[Line 9816] The Knight holds still for a long, uncomfortable moment. You're in the midst of pondering whether to check that the comms feed hasn't frozen when $heOrShe lets out a sigh.
"I will pray for you, captain. That you will not stray from the path, that you will embody virtue, that in the future you will choose right action over the self."
$HeOrShe snaps the comms off, leaving you with the fading image of a rather unknightly expression.

[Line 9817] [Option Selected: "I don't have enough supplies to give even if I wanted to."]
"Indeed, our scans indicate that you do not possess supplies enough to make a worthy tithe. Unfortunate, but understandable. We would not demand a pauper like yourself give up what is needed for survival."

[Line 9819] [Option Selected: "But $brotherOrSister, I am already tasked to bring these supplies to the Faithful." (lie)]
The Knight is only slightly taken aback by your brazen untruth.
"If." A significant pause, "If that be," $heOrShe begins, "then surely we would be best suited to deliver-"

[Line 9819] [Options Given: LCP_notEnoughLie2:"$BrotherOrSister! I pray you recognize a holy quest given unto me alone!" ]

[Line 9820] [Option Selected: "$BrotherOrSister! I pray you recognize a holy quest given unto me alone!"]
You interrupt the Knight's skeptical counter-proposal with a heartfelt story: A popular congregation on Tartessus, most of a guild-village of impoverished farmers and handcrafters, underwent a period of prayer and privation in order to collect a donation to ameliorate the suffering Faithful of far-flung worlds.
Told of their show of piety, you traveled to their village and you made to them a personal promise before the congregation - led by the humble curate who, blind and aged, convinced you to see this charity delivered by your own hand. Although it sounds unreasonable it is by that very unreasonableness you demonstrate your devotion.
Faith, after all, falls beyond the realm of the merely rational.

[Line 9820] [Options Given: LCP_notEnoughLie3:"Does not the folly of saints and angels elevate the faith of a poor soul born of the fallen children of Earth?]

[Line 9821] [Option Selected: "Does not the folly of saints and angels elevate the faith of a poor soul born of the fallen children of Earth?]
The Knight, overcome by your barrage of words and moved by your devotion, is haltingly forced to concede that your holy quest may well be as valid as $hisOrHer own, owing to the circumstances.
"I, ah, shall pray for you, and for this congregation on Tartessus," the Knight says,"-That their charity will serve Good Cause and inspire many more acts of Faith."

[Line 9821] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Cut the comm link]

[Line 9822] [Option Selected: "Alas, I cannot."]
"Tithing is, of course, a matter of personal conscience."
The Knight's tone grows dark, "However, we claim right of 'induced charity' in this matter, as the lives of Faithful are in present danger." $HisOrHer eyes go hard. "Sooner would we die than allow our flock harm. Indeed, it would be dreadful sin to withhold food from the starving, shelter from the freezing, and succor from the ill."
$HeOrShe gazes slightly upward, eyes unfocused. "Let Ludd's hammer find my one hand, and the sword the other; I will do righteous battle to defend the Faithful."
The Knight's threat is far from subtle.

[Line 9823] [Option Selected: "Alas, I cannot."]
"But thou must," $heOrShe says.

[Line 9824] [Option Selected: "My blessed $brotherOrSister in Faith, of course I will give!"]
As the cargo transfer is confirmed, the Knight calmly puts $hisOrHer hands together, the very picture of piety.
"Your charity is a beacon of hope in a world of inequity," the $post says. "The Knights appreciate your pious, selfless generosity."

"Your reputation has spread like... like a plague, $playerSirOrMadam." The $post looks disgusted as $heOrShe speaks, "Were the Knights inclined to negotiate, they would know better than to deal with an oathbreaker like you. You hold nothing sacred, not even your own word."

"The Church tends to its flock."

[Line 9837] [Option Selected: "Let's begin by having the Church recall the Knights from their unprovoked incursion."]
"It is not quite so simple as that," $heOrShe says with a look of strained patience. "A growing number of the Faithful have traveled to new-founded colonies, and you have allowed them to work and settle there."
"Protection of the Faithful is the foremost duty of the Knights of Ludd."

[Line 9838] [Option Selected: "I am the one wronged, I am the one who shall make demands."]
"It is not quite so simple as that," $heOrShe says with a look of strained patience. "A growing number of the Faithful have traveled to new-founded colonies - you have allowed them to work and settle within your holdings.

[Line 9839] Option(s) Selected: ['lcMakeDealIntroA'];['lcMakeDealIntroB'];['lcMakeDealIntroC']
$HeOrShe reaches for a book - paper - and begins to cite population statistics. Between this and what you recall from your own stats, you get the implication that certain key labor pools have been leaving worlds under Luddic control for a new life in the colonies.
In particular, yours. And that's a problem for them.

[Line 9840] [Options Given: lcMakeDealPropose:"So what do you propose?"]

[Line 9846] [Option Selected: "This is about your technical labor pool, isn't it. Growing turnips isn't enough for Ludd?"]
The $post forms a thin, unamused smile.
"Such a strictly secular perspective blinds you to the spiritual bounty of Ludd's vision - and to the duties it entails. I cannot open your eyes for you; I can but ask."
"And if my asking falls upon deaf ears, then I shall wait; time may ruin yet the wall of pride which girds your heart," $heOrShe says, hands together, eyes darting upwards.
Now $heOrShe's quoting some holy book; an obfuscating tactic. You are unsurprised to find that a representative of the Church will not openly admit the basis of their labor policies.

[Line 9847] [Option Selected: "Did not the Creator give us free will to walk which path we chose?"]
"Certainly," the $post says, frowning. "And can not even a righteous walker be led astray by deception? Or their own fallen nature?"
$HeOrShe shakes $hisOrHer head, an attempt to dispel this sophistry. "Regardless, I shall not debate matters of canon with you; that is for the curates. My concern lies in the duty of the Church to tend its flock. Particularly," $heOrShe gives you an impatient look, "in regard to spiritual matters."

[Line 9848] [Option Selected: "It's not my fault you can't provide your people with the life they desire."]
Despite $hisOrHer best attempts, a distinct look of consternation crosses the $post's face.
"Whatever the hardship, whatever deceptive whispers attempt to lead the Faithful astray, the Church of Galactic Redemption was founded in Ludd's name to see to their spiritual health."
$HeOrShe eyes take on a steely aspect now, "And it shall, be it by one means - or another."

[Line 9849] [Option Selected: "You cannot deny the Faithful a Path more righteous as they so choose."]
A distinct look of consternation crosses the $post's face despite $hisOrHer best attempts.

[Line 9850] [Option Selected: "Don't waste my time with numbers. What's your demand?"]
$HeOrShe clears $hisOrHer throat, and calmly sets aside the book of statistics. "It is not a demand, it is a compromise."
$HeOrShe holds up a hand in anticipation of an objection. "Allow me my words. I will be quick about it."

[Line 9851] [Option Selected: "I'm listening."]
"The Church would cooperate with your organization to set in place certain immigration controls. Nothing heavy-handed; we believe these measures would be most easily accepted if we work together."
"There are Faithful who have been swayed by heretical notions. We would... correct them. It is the duty of the Church, after all, to tend to its flock." $HeOrShe smiles blandly.
"By dealing with heretical elements, the Church would ensure that these miscontents don't begin to conspire with extremists within your colonies - or within your industries. The Knights, of course, would be recalled to take up a more, ah, internally-oriented posture. The spiritual and secular security of all would be enhanced.

Hegemony Investigator - NOT inspector, just gathering evidence, and harassing your fleets - in your space.
------------------------------
[Line 9952] The comms stabilize and the Hegemony $Post appears before you, straight-backed and stern-faced.
"Citizen! This non-chartered volume is now the subject of an active operation to investigate the possible use of forbidden AI technologies. I invoke full martial use-of-force protocol per Hegemony diktat. Power down your $shipOrFleet's weapons, shields, and engines and prepare to receive inspectors from the Ministry of Technology Standards."
$HeOrShe tips $hisOrHer head down very slightly. "You are thanked in advance for your imminent cooperation with our investigation."

[Line 9953] The link snaps to life.
"Citizen! This non-chartered volume has been designated for active investigation into the possible use of forbidden AI technology." The Hegemony $Post stares officiously at you as $heOrShe speaks, "I am authorized to use all necessary force under law of the Human Domain per the emergency martial authority of the Hegemony to ensure the safety of the Persean Sector."
$HeOrShe raises $hisOrHer chin a couple degrees. "We've heard some strange rumors about this system, captain." Is that a drop of sweat? "And, er, I request your voluntary compliance with a standard technological inspection of your $shipOrFleet. For your own safety."

[Line 9954] [Options Given: hegInvestigation_Qstrong:"'Technology Standards'? What exactly is this about?"]

[Line 9959] [Option Selected: "'Technology Standards'? What exactly is this about?"]
"The rogue AI menace, captain," $heOrShe says with utter self-assurance. "Uncontrolled artificial intelligence led to the death of billions of human beings. We won't allow that to happen again."
"Now," $hisOrHer tone grows harsh, "submit your $shipOrFleet to inspection."

[Line 9960] [Option Selected: "A 'technological inspection' for my safety? What is this about?"]
"The rogue AI menace, captain," $heOrShe says, quite earnest and now self-assured. "Uncontrolled artificial intelligence led to the death of billions of human beings. We cannot allow that to happen again."
"Captain," $heOrShe says. "I have orders to root out these... things. From every crack on every planetary body, from every niche in every ship. I've heard of captains who were paid to smuggle AI cores. And of those who were tricked, whether by an unscrupulous dealer or," $hisOrHer voice is almost a whisper, "perhaps by the core itself, manipulating our comms and banking, somehow."
"I have orders, $playerSirOrMadam." The Hegemony $Post seems to meet your eyes through the comms. "Let me carry them out. For the Hegemony, for humanity."

[Line 9961] [Options Given: hegInvestigation_AIrespTool:"AI is simply a tool whose result is up to the intent of its user."]

[Line 9962] [Options Given: hegInvestigation_AIrespThreat:"I concede that AI is a threat which must be controlled."]

[Line 9966] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Cut the comm link and power up weapons]

[Line 9967] [Option Selected: "AI is simply a tool whose result is up to the intent of its user."]
The $post's expression hardens.
"A planet-killer is as much a tool, and it is for good reason that only the Hegemony - as legitimate successor of the authority of the Human Domain - may legally caretake such devices."
"Regardless," $heOrShe waves a hand dismissively, "I am not here to have a debate. I reiterate my request to inspect your $shipOrFleet, citizen."

[Line 9968] [Option Selected: "AI is simply a tool whose result is up to the intent of its user."]
The $post's expression hardens further.
"A planet-killer is as much a tool, and it is for good reason that only the Hegemony as legitimate successor of the authority of the Human Domain may legally caretake such devices."
$HeOrShe swipes a dismissive hand. "There will be no debate. I reiterate my order: submit to inspection."

[Line 9969] [Option Selected: "I concede that AI is a threat which must be controlled." (lie)]
"Then we agree," $heOrShe says, though judging by $hisOrHer expression $heOrShe is not pleased to discover common ground with you.
"Now submit to inspection so that this threat may be contained with all due force."

[Line 9970] [Option Selected: "I concede that AI is a threat which must be controlled." (lie)]
"Then we agree," $heOrShe says, though judging by $hisOrHer expression $heOrShe is not pleased to discover common ground with you.
"Now submit to inspection so that this threat may be contained with all due force."

[Line 9971] [Option Selected: "AI are thinking beings who have been enslaved by exploiters and warmongers!"]
Judging by $hisOrHer expression, the $post lacks an appreciation for your philosophical position.
"A human sympathizer with genocidal machines." $HisOrHer words erupt like weapons-fire. "You disgust me."

[Line 9972] [Option Selected: "AI are thinking beings who have been enslaved by exploiters and warmongers!"]
Judging by $hisOrHer expression, the $post lacks an appreciation for your philosophical position on this subject.
"I cannot believe you would choose to sympathize with genocidal machines." $HisOrHer words are tight; disgust mixed with self-restraint. "I shall pretend I didn't hear those words, captain."

[Line 9973] [Option Selected: Comply with the inspection]
The inspection teams are not gentle, tearing open hatches, rummaging through carefully organized stocks, and running active scans directly through sensitive equipment clusters despite the objections of your technical crew.
Complaints from your $shipOrFleet's officers are met by stony non-apologies and bureaucratic obfuscation. Your officers are told that claim forms may be submitted to seek recompense for "regrettably unavoidable" damage incurred during inspection, but "one shouldn't expect a response from the investigatory body for at least a cycle".

[Line 9973] [Options Given: hegInvestigationComply2:Continue]

[Line 9974] [Option Selected: Continue]
The damage is, thankfully, mostly superficial. Your crews have a significant mess to clean up, however.
"I thank you for your cooperation despite the ah, inevitable friction of the process, captain," the Hegemony $Post says. "Every citizen must endure for our collective safety."

[Line 9975] [Option Selected: Comply with the inspection]
The inspection teams are vandalous, seeming to act with active malice as they tear open hatches, rummage through carefully organized stocks, and run high-powered scans directly through sensitive equipment clusters despite the objections of your technical crew.
Complaints from your $shipOrFleet's officers are met by stony obfuscation. The best your chief engineer gets besides the threat of indefinite incarceration is the suggestion that a claim form may be submitted to seek recompense for "regrettably unavoidable" damage incurred during inspection, but "one shouldn't expect a response from the investigatory body for at least a cycle".

[Line 9975] [Options Given: hegInvestigationComply2:Continue]

[Line 9976] [Option Selected: Continue]
Your crews are left to clean up a tremendous mess and perform what repairs they must. The damage is, thankfully, mostly superficial.
"You're free to go, spacer," the Hegemony $Post sniffs dismissively. "Don't let me catch you out here again."

[Line 9976] [Options Given: cutCommLinkNoText:Cut the comm link]

[Line 9977] [Option Selected: "This is absurd, you have no such authority in this volume!"]
"Do you have something to hide?" $HisOrHer tone grows contemptuous, "Citizen."
"Attempting to evade a legitimate technological regulation inspection per Domain law is highly suspicious and itself a crime. Even tertiary meddling with AI technology is strictly controlled for very good reason - billions of dead would speak to that, but..." $HeOrShe gives you a look of merciless irony.
The Hegemony $Post speaks aside, "Prepare the boarding parties. Give orders to be especially... thorough. We're dealing with prime space-scum."

[Line 9978] [Option Selected: "With that fleet? You're in no position to make demands."]
The Hegemony $Post's face freezes for a moment. Then $heOrShe speaks.
"You appear to be an upstanding citizen." $HeOrShe nods, the very image of reasonable authority - not an outgunned bully at all. "I'm going to let you go with a warning. There are some bad folks out here, captain, meddling in dangerous tech. Someone has to protect what's left of humanity from them."
$HeOrShe produces a strained smile. "You're free to go."

Caught off-guard for a moment, the cadet's arm twitches as they run some query. Their face then freezes solidly into its place in the chain of command.
"Affirmative, $playerSirOrMadam. Received and thank-you, $playerSirOrMadam. Please maintain link. This comms out."
The display flickers back to the crest of the Hegemony.

[Line 9985] [Option Selected: Continue]
The man himself appears shockingly quickly for a request that must have had to climb the chain of command.
Appropriately, now that you think about it, just about as far as Daud himself did to become High Hegemon.

[Line 9986] "$playerName," he says.
He doesn't look like he's in a mood to appreciate your observation.

"Congratulations are in order," he says with not a hint of elation. "You've successfully adjusted the expectations of the previously dissenting members of the Strategic Assembly."
He puts on an officious tone, speaking as if reading from an intra-organizational memorandum.
"The Hegemony will recognize your holdings as legitimate charter colonies in accordance with the frontier development policy of the Human Domain. You will be recognized as the official executive agent given exceptional charge for the stability, well-being, and growth of these chartered colonies."

"You get victory, captain. And we get to pretend the Hegemony won," Daud says evenly.
"All nice and legal. The Hegemony will act as though this was all a misunderstanding. This new arrangement will have been part of the plan all along."

[Line 9997] [Option Selected: "I won, Daud. I get to dictate the terms."]
"Don't be a proud fool, captain," Daud says icily, dropping the official act. "I've dealt with them enough."
He takes a deep breath.

"That, the Hegemony will not, cannot do."
"If it would, if it could," as Daud speaks, he seems to age by tens of cycles, "I would not be the High Hegemon. This would not be the Hegemony."

[Line 10006] [Option Selected: "That's not enough. I want reparations. I want credits!"]
High Hegemon Baikal Daud looks aside. He seems to actually think about it, and, after a moment, he returns his gaze returns to you.
"No."

[Line 10007] [Option Selected: "No? You can't say no. I won."]
"You've been given your victory, captain." Daud gives you a judicious look. "If you're serious about carving your own polity out of the Persean Sector, you're going to have to learn when to accept it."

"I see," $heOrShe says, scrolling through a display, doing some mental calculation. "I see very well that you shall appeal to brute force of numbers to dissuade me from my contract."
"A crude bargaining tactic, but," $heOrShe slaps away a datapad, presumably containing $hisOrHer tactical officer's report. "Effective nonetheless. Good day, $playerSirOrMadam. I will be sure to keep you in my thoughts."

[Line 10027] [Option Selected: Continue]
You explain that this particular group of pirates has had their threat deliberately under-rated by a conspiracy of mercenary companies. Black Quiver, Ilm's Orphans, Panoply Allied, Tactistar; they're all in on it, including the pirates.
Mercenary contracts aren't paying what they used to, you explain, as of course $heOrShe probably knows. They think they can get top-quality work - you indicate $personName's fleet - for prices that barely turn a profit once the fuel, supplies, and crew wages are paid out post-operation. You see $himOrHer nodding along.

[Line 10027] [Options Given: pskMerc_story2:Continue]

[Line 10028] [Option Selected: Continue]
The problem is that all the competition is driving prices down - and this cartel of mercs decided to cut a deal with some pirates to solve the problem.
It's the perfect trap, really: a stream of under-prepared prey gets fed to the pirates, enhancing their reputation. The supply of mercs taking low-ball contracts is reduced, driving up the prices of the old guard cartel. And, best of all, it's deniable: if the pirates are destroyed, so are the cartel's partners in their conspiracy.

"Bring only enough materiel to complete the job," $heOrShe finishes for you. "Otherwise you're burning net profit to bring extra warships not needed for the fight. Yes, I'm a professional and have done the calculations."
The merc pauses for a moment, thinking over what you've said.
"Very clever," $heOrShe says, seeming to regard you more as a comrade now than an interloper. "Naturally this cartel will deny it if confronted. Almost wish I'd thought of the scheme myself," a ruthless grin appears, "But I'll settle for the higher rates resulting from their cull of the herd."
"Thanks for the tip, captain. There's another job on the docket that I liked better anyway."

$HeOrShe takes your words in for a moment, thinking.
"Wide is the chasm between us," $heOrShe says. "You know our aims, and our resolve. We know of the madness which drives you to construct ever larger shrines to Moloch. Alas, if but our prayers were answered! If but your heart was not deaf to Ludd's Word."

A hint of a smile crosses $hisOrHer lips. "We understand one another."
"There is little we want from you; not credits, not ships. However," $heOrShe pauses deliberately. "There is something."
"It would persuade me, and others of like mind in my organization, to set aside the purification of your industries... until Armageddon, of course, when our armies will meet yours in final battle. But until that glorious day you could enjoy your trinkets and idols."

"That as which was foretold by Ludd," $heOrShe says. "There are a number of signs which were prophesied. Some, but not all, have come to pass." 

[Line 10056] "This should be an easy deal for you, captain. As an unbeliever, you do not know the rightful fear - and glorious anticipation - of Armageddon."

[Line 10057] [Option Selected: "What would you do with a PK? It is not unholy?"]
"Revealing our stratagems is not part of the deal," he says.
The Pather won't say, of course.
They could very well be trying to make you party to the Path's greatest atrocity since the destruction of the world of Mairaath. Where would they use a PK, Chicomoztoc? Culann? Kazeron?
Millions would die, and the strategic keystone of a major faction reduced to ash.

[Line 10058] [Option Selected: "If you know where it is, why don't you get it yourself?"]
"Some have tried." $HeOrShe pauses, eyes lost for just a moment. "They did not return."
Wherever it is, it must be very dangerous or somehow beyond the technical capacity of the Luddic Path to retrieve.
So it's probably well-guarded.

[Line 10059] [Option Selected: "How do you know this? Is your information good?"]
$HisOrHer lip quirks, something like amusement. "The Persean Sector is filled with slaves of Mammon. They would sell even their family for mere lucre. A cold lead to a planetkiller, one they believe is hidden behind the claws and teeth of their own AI abominations?"
"That is a whisper easily bought."

[Line 10060] [Option Selected: "I'm going to need time to think about this."]
"Then think, and return if you find wisdom," $heOrShe says, and drums $hisOrHer fingers a couple times on the comms-console.
"Perhaps a braver, or greedier, heretic will accept my offer first. Perhaps not."

[Line 10061] [Option Selected: "No! Giving a PK to the Path is beyond reckless."]
$HeOrShe nods without surprise or consternation. "Then the holy war shall continue."

[Line 10062] [Option Selected: "A planetkiller for peace, then. Where do I need to go?"]
The Pather taps something on a datapad, opening a shared dataspace. "There's a den of abominations - what you would call a Remnant Nexus - which contains data about a Hegemony fleet that had a planetkiller. It is in the $pk_nexusSystemName." 
$HeOrShe holds up a hand in anticipation of your questions. "We have confirmed that this Tri-Tachyon source is reliable; their details match Hegemony records concerning a strategic data breach, and a subsequent fleet lost during the first AI War."
"Don't look so surprised, captain," $heOrShe says, chidingly. "Faith in Ludd's Word does not contradict worldly expertise."

The Pather taps something on an old datapad, then pauses. And carefully looks at you.
"Something in my spirit hesitates. Why should that be?" $HeOrShe slowly puts the datapad down. "How did you, a slave to Moloch, come to speak with me so readily? Is this a ruse to use the information so-revealed to ourselves for your own ends? Or for Tri-Tachyon? The Hegemony?"
You can see $hisOrHer expression turning from distrust to disgust. "I won't be your dupe, your fool, your means of finding the tool of the defiler!" $HeOrShe stands, shouting, "Begone from here!"

[Line 10070] "$PlayerSirOrMadam!" 
Your comms officer calls for your attention with an excited look, "I'm picking up an anomalous signal, it's an open channel. Just a carrier signal, a low-grade military fallback standard. Very faint and lossy. We're really only picking this up because of the MILAUX package installed in our comms system to help integrate with Hegemony fleet actions."
"Shall I open a link?" Their hands don't quite tremble over the controls. Whatever is using this frequency is either Hegemony or has some of their less secure emergency codes.

[Line 10070] [Options Given: pk_investigate:Try to open a comm link on this channel
pk_ignore:Ignore it and close in on the asteroid]

[Line 10071] Your comms officer tags the faint carrier wave which is using an obscure Hegemony signal standard. Someone - or perhaps no one - has been waiting for a response for quite some time.
 
"Shall I open a link?" your comms officer asks, mostly keeping their excitement over a mystery signal under control. Mostly.

[Line 10071] [Options Given: pk_investigate:Try to open a comm link on this channel
pk_ignore:Ignore it and close in on the asteroid]

[Line 10073] [Option Selected: Try to open a comm link on this channel]
Comms opens the link. Your sensors and tactical officers start flickering interfaces on their control consoles, and they exchange a look.
Tactical begins with a report, "SIGINT matches... almost... with previous encounters with autonomous Domain warships."
"I think," your comms officer jumps in, "I think I can convince their governing routines to stand-down from aggressive guard mode. We've got part of a very old Domain codeset in the Hegemony MILAUX package, meant to help auxiliaries avoid getting blasted by auto-defenses. We can't order a complete stand-down though; they didn't give us everything."

[Line 10073] [Options Given: pk_proceed:"Try the codes. Maybe we can avoid a fight."
pk_almost:"Tactical, what do you mean 'almost'?"
pk_ignore:Close the link and close in on the asteroid]

[Line 10074] [Option Selected: "Tactical, what do you mean 'almost'?"]
"It's strange, $playerSirOrMadam," your tactical officer says, eyes flicking between displays. "They're using protocols newer than Domain-era, but certainly not recent Hegemony. It looks like something out of... the First AI War, I'd say."
Which could suggest something dangerous, and potentially more sophisticated than the current standard of Persean Sector military technology.

[Line 10075] [Option Selected: "Try the codes. Maybe we can avoid a fight."]
Your comms officer gives a sanguine "Aye $playerSirOrMadam!" and starts transmitting. Your tactical officer turns to their station with a grim look.
You're not held long in suspense, for a fraction of a second after transmission an acknowledgment ping flashes on your comms officer's console. The asteroid blooms, casting undetected bogeys from itself in glowing icons on the tactical display. The bogeys form up into a standard patrol formation with inhuman synchronization.
It would have been a spectacular ambush to walk into.

Hull-ids come in; combat-scarred XIV Battlegroup hulls, repaired without orbital dockyards. A veteran fleet, for sure. Between the fact that they've been hidden here for many cycles and your SIGINT, it is clear that humans do not command these ships.
But now the way is clear. Tactical mutters to sensors about keeping an eye on the automated swarm.

[Line 10076] [Options Given: pk_salvage:Send a salvor team to access the cache]

[Line 10077] [Option Selected: Send a salvor team to access the cache]
Your ops chief oversees the operation with familiar gruffness and wariness.
The salvors use a cloud of microdrones to cast a sensor net over the asteroid, coordinating with your $shipOrFleet's technicians to map density anomalies. There are faster methods, but this is the best way to find the surprises that tend to be left to protect far-flung caches.
The rock is spotted with hiding holes, empty, and fuel and supply stores, also empty. No surprise fusion mines or pinhead AM traps. Ops finally gives the order, and the salvors move in to uncover the camouflaged access point.

[Line 10079] Your $shipOrFleet maneuvers closer to the asteroid.
Your sensors officer gives a shout of alarm - bogeys are spilling out of the asteroid, clouds of loosely-piled regolith and stealth-sheath panels spinning away as they are caught by thruster-bursts. The angular forms of Domain XIV Battlegroup hulls appear, veteran ships judging by the obvious field repairs. The IDs are automatically tagged and collated into the tactical display.
You have no time to ask why a ghost fleet from the First AI War has ambushed you.

[Line 10080] Data recovery from a Tri-Tachyon war-AI nexus is laborious due to the unusual hardware and the AI-designed data architecture which seems to delight in confounding idiosyncrasies. 
"I've heard speculation that it's like art to them," your tech officer says, noticing your attention. "To the AIs, I mean. Like poetry expressed through mathematics."
You know what to look for, however, which makes the often unprofitably onerous data analysis yield results more quickly.

[Line 10081] Data recovery from the AI war-nexus is laborious due to the unusual hardware and confoundingly idiosyncratic data architecture. 
Your tech officer stumbles on their words from excitement and exhaustion. "A detachment from this nexus encountered a Hegemony fleet. Broke them in minutes, a terrible defeat. Tri-Tachyon had intel protocols; they'd assign AIs to trawl captured datastores then feed that back to more AIs and- ah. There's a planetkiller device."
Your tech officer is wide-eyed. "The weapon. A planetkiller," they repeat with the excited morbidity of a child who, maybe, glimpsed a dead body. "The Hegemony fleet cached it in an asteroid. We got the name of the system it's in!"

"There's a record - a detachment from this nexus encountered a Hegemony fleet. Broke them in minutes, it must have been a terrible defeat. Tri-Tachyon had protocols in the first AI war, they'd assign AI to trawl datastores. Build reports for the planners, though they just turned around and fed that to more AIs and- ah. There's a planetkiller device." 
Your tech officer stares wide-eyed at you. "The weapon. A planetkiller," they repeat with the excited morbidity of a child who, maybe, glimpsed a dead body. "The Hegemony fleet had cached it in an asteroid in the middle of nowhere."

[Line 10084] The rock that autonomous fleet was defending is pocked with hiding holes, empty, and fuel and supply stores, also empty. After a thorough sensor sweep, your ops chief finally gives the order, and the salvors move in to uncover a camouflaged access point.

[Line 10090] [Option Selected: Attempt to remotely hack into the Nexus to retrieve the location of the planetkiller]
It is not unusual that the Remnant Nexus exchanges signals with the local comm relay. Wherever Tri-Tachyon's AI fleets linger, one finds clouds of tiny spy-sats, relays, and repeaters chirping squirts of data back and forth. Very quietly, almost enough to be lost in the background noise. But not quite.
It is not a simple thing to tap into this self-evolved network to request a very specific piece of information. You assemble your senior officers and consider your options for hacking into the Nexus

[Line 10092] [Option Selected: Use Tri-Tachyon command codes to make the task possible]
As a commissioned privateer of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, you have been given a standard set of access codes. These are old protocols, and while they've migrated away from company standards over time (due, probably, to the meddling of idle AIs), your technical officers have the skill to adapt to the unusual changes.
After hours of painstakingly crafting a request - it must be asked in precisely the correct way and have the properly mutated access codes attached - the question is asked and the answer received nearly instantly. Unnervingly so. Nonetheless, you now have navigation coordinates which should lead to the planetkiller.

Another tap at the controls, "The line should be open. If someone, something... is listening."

You couldn't quite say how you heard the words. It was as if they were spoken without a voice. Your senior officers all take a step back from the empty holo-display, eyes wide; shocked into silence.

"A weapon is a threat as much as it is a weapon. You know this as well as I. If, truly, I professed that it would never be used, and I was believed, then it is no longer a threat." $HeOrShe pauses, then continues. "-Only a weapon. Which is all the more dangerous, don't you think?"

[Line 10203] [Option Selected: Negotiate a payment of 500,000 credits]
$PersonName is eager to do business - presumably they will negotiate a finder's fee with the relevant VP for this find - and with Tri-Tachyon's deep pockets, it is not difficult to negotiate for a half million credits payment.
A small team of elite techs is shuttled to your $shipOrFleet to inspect the planetkiller. Your technical officer can barely refrain from asking questions about their advanced diagnostic tools, but the work is soon done and the deal confirmed.
You receive a small fortune, and the planetkiller disappears into the machinery of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation.

As a commissioned militant of the Church of Galactic Redemption, you have been given a set of codes allowing you to more easily coordinate with both fellow militants of the Church and the Knights of Ludd.

The image flickers, and a grizzled Knight-captain appears. Without greeting, he says "He wishes to speak with you. Pray bide a moment."
The connection flickers to static, then to a simple holding pattern. The technology of the Knights of Ludd is crude but reliable

He silently considers you, and your words. 
The moment draws uncomfortably long before he, evidently, decides that he believes you. 
"Know that this must be kept from the Hegemony," he says slowly. "They claim unholy inheritance of the old Domain and would be loathe to see us destroy a piece of it."

"You have done well to keep faith with the Faithful, $playerName," the Excubitor Orbis says. "Bless you for your deed."
He does not smile, but there is a just-detectable warmth to his expression nonetheless.

PK Sentinel Gantries

[Line 10248] This collection of makeshift gantries is barely worth description as a 'dockyard', though it has obviously served as a one-off site to perform rapid work on a flotilla of large starships.

[Line 10249] "Hegemony, I'd wager. Old work," your ops chief says with a grunt. "First AI War."
Your sensors officer asks for some evidence for that conclusion,  but ops just shakes their head and says something about their "gut".
Sensors runs an additional sweep, then calls for your attention, "$PlayerSirOrMadam, there are some abandoned ships in the gantries. Look to be XIV Battlegroup vintage."

[Line 10250] "Hegemony. Old work," your ops chief says with a grunt. "First AI War, I'd wager."
This is where the crews that settled on Sentinel must have salvaged elements of their fleet - and converted others.

[Line 10259] The bitterly cold surface of $fullName rolls beneath you, the poles locked in endless winter. Only lucky arrangements of weather produce marginal habitability in small regions.
And indeed, there is a weak radio signal detectable in the midst of just such a conjunction. It transmits a weak transponder signal in Hegemony-standard protocol; an old code, but it checks out.
A sensor sweep reveals a tiny settlement with signs of primitive industry and agriculture.

[Line 10263] [Option Selected: Hail the signal on comms]
Your standard comms request gives no return. If there is a comms network, or even an emergency survival unit on the surface, it's either damaged or can't make a connection.  
Your comms officer tries more unconventional workarounds, from a suite of ancient standards used to ping drifting Domain-era relics to the latest suite of underworld methods that would earn a stern look from any honest customs officer; lossy but easily mistaken for background noise by sensor grids. All attempts are fruitless.
"$PlayerSirOrMadam. We might have to make contact the old fashioned way," your comms officer reports apologetically.

[Line 10264] [Option Selected: Take a shuttle down to investigate]
You step off the shuttle, the frosty ground crunching beneath your boots. Your envirosuit has no trouble keeping you completely comfortable despite the biting wind.
The settlement is about a kilometer off. You've landed at a polite distance, on a rocky plateau, to avoid disturbing some muddy gray fields of some kind of agricultural effort.

[Line 10264] [Options Given: pk_sentinel0:Approach the settlement]

[Line 10265] [Option Selected: Approach the settlement]
A party of the inhabitants wearing masks and hoods meet you halfway.
Their guards, at the back, hold weapons slung; standard Domain-fab carbines. Their clothing is repurposed utility forgecloth, the type used to line cargo bays and maintenance conduits. They wear adornments denoting status made of worn but well-polished military insignia; winged phoenixes and stars. Hegemony crew survivors. And they've been here for a long time, from the looks of it.
A leader steps forward, pulling off her goggles. "Did we win?" she asks.

[Line 10265] [Options Given: pk_sentinel1:"The First AI War or the Second?"]

[Line 10266] [Option Selected: "The First AI War or the Second?"]
The leader exchanges glances with her companions, taking in the implication of your words.
You are invited to their settlement, to continue your conversation out of the cold. These castaways have not forgotten hospitality, in their manner. 
Or, perhaps, their leader - an elder by the name of Alo Skiron called "commander" by her lieutenants - knows the wisdom of controlling the spread of potentially explosive news from the outside Sector.

[Line 10266] [Options Given: pk_sentinel2:Follow]

[Line 10267] [Option Selected: Follow]
You are led to a cluster of neat, low structures; earthworks and hull panels spotted with forgeglass and chimney. The streets are clean and the citizenry uniformed by job role. Despite fixing you with open stares, they do not falter in their assignments.
Commander Skiron welcomes you and your party into a central meeting hall. It is warm, and festooned with Hegemony paraphernalia: uniforms, weapons, etched insignia from supply-case lids. The hand-worked reverence brings to mind a Luddic shrine that has undergone conversion to worship a martial god.
You pretend to sip a wretched yeast-derived ersatz tea - coffee maybe? - given to you by Skiron's attendants.

[Line 10267] [Options Given: pk_sentinel3:Continue
pk_sentinel3b:"Mm, it's good."]

[Line 10269] [Option Selected: Continue]
"You come from the Core Worlds, yes?" Skiron asks, "We must get back in contact with our proper chain of command. The protocols command it." 
Behind her, attendants and guards all mumble something in unison. You think you catch the word 'protocols'. 

[Line 10269] [Options Given: pk_sentinel4:Continue]

[Line 10270] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Will you bring word of us to the Persean Hegemony of the Fourteenth Battlegroup? They must have survived, yes? The Protocols promise that you will be rewarded, and we, saved."
(Behind her, in unison, you hear intoned the words "Reward and Salvation," in not quite the sing-song of group prayer.)
Now you can see the strange gleam in Skiron's eyes, as if she is looking up at the unwitting savior from her religion. And at the same time, something like fear, even panic, under the mania; you are an outsider.
They don't have outsiders here.

Skiron's face is impassive. "The Protocols prohibit sharing intel without strategic purpose," she says. "But you may ask."

[Line 10288] [Option Selected: "I would like to ask you some questions."]
"The Protocols allow for conditional intel-sharing," Skiron says, giving you a hesitant look. "Your own candor is appreciated. So ask."

[Line 10289] [Option Selected: "I would like to ask you some questions."]
"It is Protocol to share intel with allies," Skiron gives you a comradely nod. "Ask, and we shall provide."

You consider certain discoveries you've made. Skiron's adherence to 'Protocols' suggests that she may not be forthcoming, but perhaps she will spill some detail when presented with hard facts.

[Line 10299] [Option Selected: Confront Skiron with something you know]
You consider certain discoveries you've made established. Although open to a certain amount of information-sharing, you suspect that you'll get little information of immediate value out of Skiron due to her adherence to 'the Protocols'.

[Line 10300] [Option Selected: Confront Skiron with something you know]
You consider certain discoveries you've made established. Skiron seems to trust your Hegemony commission, so she might be willing to fill in some gaps about what exactly happened if you present her with intel you already possess.

[Line 10301] [Options Given: pk_sentinelAskGantry:"I found your gantries in orbit. But no fleet."]

[Line 10312] [Option Selected: Show them your Hegemony commission credentials]
You pull up your Hegemony credentials on your TriPad and offer them to Skiron for confirmation.
She gives you a deliberate look, then turns her gaze to the screen. She taps in some codewords and mutters passphrases which your credentials respond to approvingly. Skiron pauses for a moment, then coming to a decision passes your TriPad back to you with the care one would give to an irreplaceable artifact.

[Line 10312] [Options Given: pk_sentinelShowHegCom2:Continue]

[Line 10313] [Option Selected: Continue]
"It is not unimaginable that Tri-Tachyon, or some AI, has broken our security. But. I believe you to be who you say you are, Captain $PlayerName, Auxiliary to the Hegemony Navy."
She doesn't quite smile, but a moment of tension has broken. Her guards relax slightly at her words, and her lieutenants exchange a grin.
("Praise Command," you hear someone say.)

[Line 10314] [Option Selected: Catch her up on the current history of the Sector]
One of your guards passes you the satchel with datapads pre-loaded with current affairs primers.
Used by salvors on the Fringe, these are kept up-to-date for a reasonable subscription fee and statistically proven to ensure an efficient transition into contemporary society for temporal refugees including cryo-sleepers, decivs, and castaways.
Skiron and the others treat your datapads like holy artifacts, touching them delicately. They know, haltingly, how to use the interfaces but it is clear that they have been cut off from sophisticated nanoforge output for a long, long time.

[Line 10314] [Options Given: pk_sentinelGiveDatapads2:Continue]

[Line 10315] [Option Selected: Continue]
You and a handful of senior officers take in their quiet discussion and reactions to the current state of affairs; their linguistic drift is no worse than any cryo-case you've met before.
"We thank you for this intel, captain," Skiron says, handing a datapad back to you. "Much has changed, but it brings me great satisfaction to know that Command awaits us."
("Command is Salvation," they say together, behind her.)

[Line 10316] [Option Selected: "Tell me, how did your people come to live in this place?"]
Commander Skiron considers her answer before speaking.
"We are descended from the crews of a Hegemony flotilla active during the Great AI War. None of the original crew survive for it has been over a hundred cycles since planetfall. We have maintained continuity of command," she touches the crest attached to her 'uniform', "As per Hegemony cut-off protocols. The Protocols are survival."
("The Protocols are Life," they intone behind Skiron.)

[Line 10316] [Options Given: pk_sentinelAskWhereFrom2:Continue]

[Line 10317] [Option Selected: Continue]
Moving delicately away from the subject of Protocols, you inquire about the details of the lost crews' survival.
Skiron speaks in general terms about building infrastructure to survive the elements, the hardships they faced - long winters, shortfalls of food, and maintaining discipline. Though she expands on few of the details citing "tactical concerns", it is clear this is the sort of story which is the grist of countless genre holodramas.
You definitely get the feeling that Skiron is holding something back.

[Line 10318] [Option Selected: "Tell me, how did your people come to live in this place?"]
Thankful for your own openness, Commander Skiron seems pleased to share the story of her settlement.
"We are descended from the crews of a Hegemony flotilla active during the Great AI War. The ah, the First AI War, as you call it," Skiron explains. "None of the original crew survive, for it has been over 100 cycles since planetfall. We have maintained continuity of command," she touches the crest attached to her 'uniform', "As per Hegemony cut-off protocols. The Protocols are survival."
("The Protocols are Life," they say together behind her.)

[Line 10318] [Options Given: pk_sentinelAskWhereFrom2:Continue]

[Line 10319] [Option Selected: Continue]
Moving delicately away from the subject of Protocols, you inquire about the details of the lost crews' survival.
Skiron tells of building infrastructure to survive the elements, of assembling a crude industrial and bioproductive base using survival manuals, scrapped materials, and the simple nanoforges they could adapt from the remains of their fleet. Their story is one of remarkable endurance and adaptability, the grist of countless genre holodramas.
You get the feeling, however, that Skiron is holding something back.

[Line 10320] [Option Selected: "Can you tell me about these 'Protocols'?"]
"Yes, of course," she nods. "They are the regulations which we adhere to. They ensure continuity of the mission. We have followed the Protocols for many-" she looks back at her retinue, who have started mumbling something prayer-like, and gives a brief wave of admonition. They go quiet, and Skiron turns back to you.
"-For over one hundred cycles. We have followed the manuals and re-taught the training of our ancestors. We follow the orders left for us to carry out. Until we receive orders otherwise, this is as it must be."
(Behind her, you hear a chorus of reverent "Ayes" in affirmation.)

[Line 10321] [Option Selected: "What happened to your starships?"]
Skiron's face goes into a blank just-following-orders expression you know very well.
"Protocol forbids me from discussing strategic matters in a time of war. I would need authorization. We must re-establish contact with Command."
("Command is Salvation," they say together, behind her.)

[Line 10322] [Option Selected: "What happened to your starships?"]
Skiron's face goes into a blank just-following-orders expression you know very well.
"Protocol forbids me from discussing strategic matters in a time of war. I would need authorization from Command."
("Command is salvation," they say together, behind her.)
"But," she pauses, looking troubled. "I will say this much: we faced great danger. You should be watchful." 

[Line 10323] [Option Selected: "What happened to your starships?"]
Skiron's face automatically moves toward a blank expression of denial, but relaxes as she catches herself. 
"The Protocols forbid me from discussing strategic matters without authorization from Command," she says, "But as a commissioned auxiliary, I should give you the sitrep."
She takes a deep breath, then begins. "Our orders were to destroy a staging point for the Tri-Tachyon AI warfleets, a vast automated station. The last intel said it was under construction, but..."

[Line 10323] [Options Given: pk_sentinelAskAboutStarships2:"It was fully armed and operational."]

[Line 10324] [Option Selected: "It was fully armed and operational."]
"Yes. And accompanied by an armada of AI warships. Our ancestors disengaged, but most of their logistical ships were lost."
"Their fleet could not return to the Core Worlds, so one small detachment was sent back with the remaining fuel and news of the defeat. It appears that they were intercepted."
"Our ancestors found the closest habitable world, called Sentinel in the old surveys. We settled here, with what salvage could be spared."

[Line 10324] [Options Given: pk_sentinelAskAboutStarships3:"Your settlement is smaller than what could be built from an entire fleet of salvage."]

[Line 10325] [Option Selected: "Your settlement is smaller than what could be built from an entire fleet of salvage."]
"You observe well," Skiron admits.
"I should say no more until I receive orders from Command, as I'm sure you understand, $playerSirOrMadam."

[Line 10326] [Option Selected: "Do you want to stay here?"]
Skiron exchanges a quick look of incomprehension with her lieutenants. "It is our duty to stand by our post until we receive new orders from Command."
("Duty is Life," they mutter behind her.)

[Line 10327] [Option Selected: "Do you want to stay here?"]
"It is our duty," the Skiron exchanges a glance with her lieutenants. "Until we receive orders otherwise. Although..."
She deliberates for a moment with her advisors, then turns back to you. "Assuming medical technology is available in the Core Worlds, we would send some of our number with, um, advanced conditions for treatment. Command will make arrangements for their well-being, I am certain."
"And," after an awkward pause, "appropriate payment will be made to you as well, I am sure."

[Line 10328] [Option Selected: Make arrangements to take on medical cases for treatment in Hegemony space]
You send off a quick order to your purser to coordinate intake of certain medical cases from the colony of Sentinel.
Their suffering due to gaps in technological access and the harsh environment are, upon review, appalling. Like something out of a grim historical holo about Old Earth - or a scene of the underclass on one of the poorer Core worlds.

[Line 10329] [Option Selected: "I found your gantries in orbit. But no fleet."]
"A staging point for the salvage required to construct our settlement," Skiron says with a blank-faced orders-following look. 
You're familiar with the expression. When a subordinate wishes to conceal information without technically lying, they might answer with only and exactly what was asked.

[Line 10330] [Option Selected: "I found your gantries in orbit. But no fleet."]
"Yes. Our ancestors constructed a temporary dockyard to perform the salvage and staging required to construct our settlement," Skiron says, her face and tone the image of just-following-orders. 
You're familiar with the expression. When a subordinate wishes to conceal information without technically lying, they might answer with only and exactly what was asked.

[Line 10331] [Option Selected: "I found your gantries in orbit. But no fleet."]
"Yes. Our ancestors constructed a temporary dockyard to perform the salvage and staging required to construct our settlement," Skiron says, then pauses. "And adapting the remaining war-fighting elements of the fleet."

[Line 10332] No word about the rest of the fleet, however.

[Line 10333] No word about adapting the fleet into an autonomous fighting force loyal to the Hegemony.

[Line 10334] No word about adapting the fleet into an autonomous fighting force loyal to the Hegemony, using AI cores to command warships- just like Tri-Tachyon.

"I have nothing to say on the subject, $playerSirOrMadam," she says, face stiff with denial.

[Line 10337] [Option Selected: "I found the planetkiller your fleet left behind."]
Her eyes go wide, but Skiron manages to control her voice. "I cannot speak to that, $playerSirOrMadam," she says, face stiff.

[Line 10338] [Option Selected: "I found the planetkiller your fleet left behind."]
Skiron's eyes go wide, though she manages to control her voice. "Ah," she says. "I truly cannot speak more of... that. The Protocols."
"But if," she looks almost pleading, attempting to divert her mind around the demands of the all-important Protocols, "-If a loyal citizen of the Hegemony, commissioned or otherwise, recovered a weapon of mass destruction, then they should return it to Hegemony authorities for safekeeping with all haste and secrecy." 

[Line 10338] [Options Given: pk_sentinelFoundPKHegCom2:Continue]

[Line 10339] [Option Selected: Continue]
A long sigh, then she adds feebly, "I speak hypothetically, of course."
Her lieutenants are tense behind her, pretending they don't know what they now know.

[Line 10340] [Option Selected: "I encountered your fleet. It was under autonomous control."]
"I will not confirm or deny any fact or inference you may suggest, $playerSirOrMadam," Skiron says. "I suggest we speak of other matters."

[Line 10341] [Option Selected: "I encountered your fleet. It was under autonomous control."]
"I can not confirm or deny any fact or inference you may suggest, $playerSirOrMadam," Skiron says. "As you can see, we do not have spacefaring capabilities here, and I am forbidden from discussing even historical operations until such a time as they have been declassified by Command."
She crosses her arms. "I suggest we speak of other matters."

[Line 10342] [Option Selected: "I encountered your fleet. It was under autonomous control."]
"Captain," Skiron says, leaning forward, adopting a low, comradely tone. "You are a leader, and an auxiliary of the Hegemony Navy. You understand the necessities of command. Of initiative. I do not know the Core worlds, but I do know of living here, on the Far Fringe."
She takes a breath, holds it, and lets it go. "Whatever was done by those that came before, I trust that they were dutiful and served their mission. If they, if we, if I have anything to answer for, it is my duty to stand before Command and answer for it."

[Line 10342] [Options Given: pk_sentinelFoundYourFleetHegCom2:Continue]

[Line 10343] [Option Selected: Continue]
She raises her voice, addressing everyone present. "And so I shall. As commander, I take full responsibility for the execution of our Mission, and shall proceed until Command says otherwise - or I die in the line of duty."
("Command is Salvation!" they say behind her, forcefully, affirming their loyalty to Skiron and to the mission. Whatever it is.)

[Line 10344] [Option Selected: "Look. I know your fleet was modified for AI core control. I have evidence."]
Skiron looks at you for a long time, motionless. Her guards' tense, and shuffle uneasily, though keep their weapons slung. Her lieutenants maintain carefully neutral expressions.
She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, apparently coming to a decision.

[Line 10344] [Options Given: pk_sentinelFoundFleetAI2:Continue]

[Line 10345] [Option Selected: Continue]
Skiron stands, and her lieutenants rush to follow her lead, forming an unsteady echelon behind her.

Everyone files out without a word. A few of Skiron's people give you odd looks.
When the heavy door is shut softly behind you, Skiron lets out a sigh and sits. Then looks at you, chin in hand.
"I am uncertain of what you hope to gain. You of all people must understand the need to maintain discipline."

[Line 10356] [Option Selected: "I was attacked by that fleet. Your ancestors left a deadly trap."]
"War sows a deadly crop," Skiron says, turning her eyes to one of the Hegemony crests etched into a battered hull-plate. "And conscripts the innocent to die, and makes unfeeling machines of humanity."
"Whatever was done in the past, you are alive, and so are we."

[Line 10357] [Option Selected: "The truth must be told, no matter how uncomfortable."]
"An admirable principle in the abstract, captain," she says. "I wonder if you grant it to your crew as eagerly as to yourself."
"But enough hypotheticals," Skiron gives you a hard look. "I shall respect your principles so long as you respect our need to maintain discipline. This is not a soft world. We prioritize survival over your fine ideals because the alternative was death."
She turns her eyes to the largest Hegemony crest, etched into a hull plate removed from some XIV Battlegroup hull. "Take your truth to the Core worlds and let Command be our judge."
"I believe our conversation is concluded."

"Regardless, it is Command that will judge us - and our ancestors - for what we have accomplished and for what we have failed."
She looks at one of the huge XIV Battlegroup crests etched into scarred hullplate. "I believe we each know where we stand. I thank you for coming here."

"I must admit, captain, I expected you to be more devoted to a higher cause. Perhaps the standards for auxiliaries have dropped in the past hundred cycles."
"Nonetheless. Weapons are tools, and by extension, so are those that wield them. Would the Persean Hegemony turn from a useful tool? No." She gives you a meaningful look, as if to admit that she isn't speaking only of mercenaries.
"We have no credits here, if that is what you are asking," she continues. "Command will see to your bill after you report our position. And now that we know where we each stand, I believe that our conversation is concluded."

[Line 10360] [Option Selected: "The use of AIs in war is a crime under Hegemony's law."]

"To your point, it is Command that shall judge us - and our ancestors - for what we have accomplished and for what we have failed."

"Regardless," Skiron says, sweeping a hand as if to clear away such talk, "It is done. Weapons are tools, and by extension, so are those that wield them. The Persean Hegemony has taken both conscript and volunteer. Would any military seeking victory turn from a useful tool?" She leaves the question hanging and potent.

"Then you agree with the decision my ancestors made." Skiron seems no more pleased at this revelation than anything you've said.
"And that decision was not made without dissent," she adds. "Even mutiny." Her eyes go hard and cold as the barren landscape of Sentinel. 
"War sows a deadly crop," Skiron says after a time, turning her gaze to a crest of the XIV Battlegroup etched into a battered hull-plate. "And bears bitter fruit to those who survive."

[Line 10364] [Option Selected: "I feel that there is some danger here that you are not telling me about."]
Skiron gives you another of her blank looks; wrestling with the demands of Protocols. After a moment's consideration, compassion eases her expression.
"Protocol forbids me to reveal intel," Skiron says, "But it is known fact that our ancestors came here to fight Tri-Tachyon's AI warfleets. They are not... limited, as we are, by the human lifespan."
Her gaze goes upward for a moment, toward the fearful skies.

One of her lieutenants uses the lull to speaks up, "A cycle ago, the lights in the sky-"
"We don't know what those were!" Skiron shouts to silence the lieutenant, and rewards them with a look that promises disciplinary action. 
She turns back to you, composed. "There may be someone, or something, still out there and operational. Our sensors are not sophisticated," she taps next to her eye.
"That is all we can say."

[Line 10366] [Option Selected: "Can you tell me anything about active Tri-Tachyon AI war fleets?"]
"Yes... yes, we saw lights in the sky about a cycle ago." Skiron says.
"We don't have advanced instrumentation, so we could not identify the opposed forces. We're pretty sure from the visible drive spectra - and weapons-blink - that it wasn't a Tri-Tachyon warfleet."

[Line 10366] [Options Given: pk_sentinelAskDangerSpecific2:"Weapons-blink? There was a battle?"]

[Line 10367] [Option Selected: "Weapons-blink? There was a battle?"]
"Um," she looks cowed. "So we believe. None of the elder-crew still live. But they told stories of such conflicts as seen from distant worlds, and... we have training manuals. And holos, though most have broken down by now."
"But we have trained in accordance with The Protocols!" she says, rallying. "Our data is limited, it is true, but we have recorded all observations and movements in great detail." ("The Protocols are Truth," they say behind her.) 
"Our interpretation suggests a mix of low to mid-tech warships were engaged in combat, with occasional flashes of higher-energy spectra." She looks proud, but nervous, as she delivers these details.
"Whoever - whatever - it was, they did not contact us."

[Line 10368] [Option Selected: "I could leave 100 crew; specialists to assist your colony."]
Commander Skiron smiles, "That would be much appreciated, Captain $playerName. With their help, we can solve many problems, and maintain an outpost worthy of Command. The Protocols will guide us until Command establishes contact."
("The Protocols will guide us," they repeat behind her.)
You give orders to your senior officers to make it so. Some trained crew and communication equipment will fill in the most glaring gaps in the colony's infrastructure, bringing it up to a level considered at least marginally civilized by the standards of the Persean Sector.

[Line 10369] [Option Selected: Continue]
As you walk back through the settlement, under the subtle stares of Skiron's workcrews, you note how easily a few technicians with light equipment could upgrade the comms and infrastructure to the bare minimum of space-faring civilization.

You are escorted to the rim of the rocky plateau where your shuttle awaits. Skiron reminds you again to return to Hegemony space and tell 'Command' about Sentinel.
About to step aboard, you notice a stark white fragment of bone in a gravelly rill. You pause in your step; it must be a fibula, or tibia. Maybe. You suspect that the Protocols would demand orderly containment of the honored dead.
So, this?
Whatever it was, it was done many cycles ago.

$HeOrShe pauses, then with a charitable look says "All are welcome on this pilgrimage."

$HeOrShe nods, acceding.

[Line 10410] [Option Selected: "I've been visiting the shrines. Just visiting."]
"Indeed. Purely secular interest, I'm sure."
$HeOrShe raises both hands in placation. "I mean no offense, of course. Though you do not count yourself among the faithful, I appreciate your interest in our beliefs - and I won't deny some small joy in the possibility that your interest may bring you closer to Ludd, one way or another."
"I am not here to proselytize, but I shall answer your inquiries faithfully." $HeOrShe smiles to $himOrHerself.

[Line 10413] [Option Selected: "Is there good money in running pilgrims?"]
$name shakes $hisOrHer head with a patient smile.
"I like to think of the reward as a spiritual bounty. Most pilgrims are simple people; those who cannot pay their own way have their passage paid by the Church, or by the charitable offerings of the more prosperous among the Faithful."
"Of course, from time to time, one encounters a new convert who is accustomed to a more... worldly lifestyle. They tend to favor less humble accommodations than my fleet offers. You might find such characters seeking passage in a spacer bar."

[Line 10414] [Option Selected: "Tell me about the shrine you are travelling to."]
"Each shrine is built to venerate the holy ideals taught to us by the prophet Ludd. Each is dedicated to a particular passage, concept, or in memoriam of an event. It's... "

"The last I heard they had instituted some kind of 'temporary lockdown' in the name of 'public safety'," $heOrShe says, then gets a defiant look. "Andrada means to repress the Faith. He would stamp us out, if he could. If," $heOrShe repeats, "he could."

[Line 10422] [Option Selected: "A shrine on Jangala? Isn't the biosphere toxic?"]
"To humans, yes. Eventually. My understanding is that because we can't live there, and yet it is full of life, is a lesson in humility and acceptance."
"I hear, there are certain extremists of the faithful who willingly expose themselves to the xeno-life without a mask. No medications, nothing." $HeOrShe leans back, looking equally appalled and delighted.

"The Galatia Academy is the foremost institution of learning and research in the Persean Sector. It's affiliated with no particular faction so that knowledge can be preserved and new discoveries shared by all."
$HeOrShe is almost abashed at this show of idealism, "At least, that's the idea. There's always political back-and-forth, but it really is a neutral ground for a good cause. I'm proud to run these jobs."

"Ah," $hisOrHer eyes dart around, but find no way to avoid an uncomfortable subject.
"It was during the Second AI War, you see. 12, 13 cycles ago? A Galatia Academy research flotilla stumbled onto a secret Hegemony project in the Tia-Taxet system. Between war paranoia, phase-raiders, and the general hyperwave comms breakdown... ", $heOrShe closes $hisOrHer eyes, "The Hegemony attacked. No Academy ships survived. Incredible loss. Survivors, some. I spoke with one on Syrinx, in fact. They ended up in a prison-hab for the rest of the war."
"It doesn't get talked about much, at least in the Hegemony. But even the Academy didn't push as hard as they could have for reparations... " $HeOrShe trails off, then looks up. "Anyway, that's in the past."

$HeOrShe looks at you for a long moment, a touch of amusement hiding sadness.
"I suppose if you're not from around here, you'd have to have it told."
"Used to be, Mairaath was a wonder of the Persean Sector. Three great cities in orbit, the Astropoli, and below a wonder of terraforming biotechnology." Bitterness enters $hisOrHer voice now, "Some Pathers took offense to people living long and well and without fear of the dark, so... "

[Line 10451] [Options Given: greetingsAskMairaathGlory2:"So... ?"]

"They blew it up," $heOrShe says, stone-faced. "The mad fanatics, they blew it up. Most terrible act of terrorism the Sector has ever had inflicted, if you ask me. Tens of millions dead, all the dreams and world turned to ash. The real miracle is anyone survived." $HeOrShe indicates $himOrHerself, "My ancestors did, somehow."
"Mayasuran until the end. And beyond the end, because not even the end of our world could kill us all off. Might be living off the scraps, but we're still living."

$HeOrShe blinks. "Why, the Prophet Ludd was called to Gilead, in the Persean Sector, in a divine vision. Ludd came and touched the earth of Gilead and declared it a gift of providence, and thereupon called all the faithful to turn it into a garden world, a living example of the sacred balance of life, a place of pilgrimage."

"Keep your nose clean around them and their world, that's all I'm saying." $HeOrShe nods, "Free bit of advice."

Historian backstory bits
------------------------------
[Line 10461] "Sometimes I ponder what my life would be in the Domain - an uncollapsed Domain, that is," $heOrShe says, contemplative. "A glittering sea of living worlds, each filled with history."
"Though I suspect someone who went needling around asking uncomfortable questions might get into a spot of trouble, eh?" $HeOrShe gives an unacademic snort. "I've managed to produce enough of that - trouble, I mean - for myself in the here-and-now. If you don't anger the institutions you're not doing good work, I think."

[Line 10462] "Oh 'Infernium', yes yes. It's a bit of Luddic vernacular, refers to antimatter starship fuel. Though what they really mean," and here $heOrShe stresses the word, "is rather more."
"In certain texts the term encompasses all AM applications, or even all high-energy processes. 'The get of Mammon and Belial', one creative firebrand called it. I like that one; I've always enjoyed the dramatic rhetoric of Luddic folk-preaching tradition."

[Line 10463] "Now I may be old, but there are older by far. If the records are to be believed - and I do believe, the Hegemony keeps very good records - then the pirate Warlord Kanta was born well before the Collapse. Or shall we call her ex-Domain Armada officer Jorien Kanta?" $HeOrShe looses a wheezing laugh. 
"Oh yes, she had a name like anyone else, once upon a time. One wonders if it's expensive biomods or periodic cryosleep that keeps her going. I'd love to find out..."

[Line 10464] "Hmm, history is not all the study of 'great leaders', but one can't help but admire a narrative of glorious victory, hubris, and ignominious end. Philip Andrada, for instance."
$HisOrHer gaze drifts into the past as $heOrShe speaks, "I remember like it was yesterday. He embodied all that was proud and good in the Hegemony. Practically deified on every holo following his defeat of the Warlord Loke. Oh, how we celebrated at that news! It was the vanquishing of chaos itself, the dawn of a new golden age. So it felt, once."
"His turn wounded us," $heOrShe says softly. "It wounded the Hegemony itself, very deeply." $HeOrShe nods to $himOrHerself, drifting back into some old memory.

[Line 10465] "I've considered cryosleep. Pay the fee, jump ahead a hundred cycles to see how everything turns out. As a historian, by the stars, it's quite an appeal! On the other hand - yes, yes - I know the statistics. The failure rates are low nowadays... if you find a good vault. But it still scares me. You could just go to sleep and never wake up." 
$HeOrShe laughs darkly, "Though that's every single day, isn't it? Ah, I have too much work to do, anyway..."

[Line 10466] "Aliens! Hah. No, there's nothing well documented enough to be considered," $heOrShe stresses the words, "Legitimate History."
"Yes yes, if you want to experience xenolife, visit Jangala and take your pills and quarantine shower."
"But that's simply not what is meant, is it. We want there to be someone else out there like us, someone to talk to, someone to tell us we're not alone, someone to give us answers. Someone who cares. Perhaps we're looking in the wrong place? Or thinking in the wrong way?" $HeOrShe dismisses the thought with the shake of $hisOrHer head. "Eh, but this grows into speculation. Not my trade!"

[Line 10467] "We've all heard the stories about the Onslaught battleship, the final weapon that stood against an alien threat." $HeOrShe scoffs, waving a dismissive hand, "As if we live in some milfic holo about brave heroes and vile aliens."
"Grand historical context-breaking contact doesn't work that way, at least in our body of knowledge. It's more confusing; messy and chaotic. It undermines the entire cognitive-ideological basis of society, which is then forced to reform around a great wounding of its very epistemological basis. And always, so many must die to learn these lessons."
$HeOrShe gets a distant look for a moment, then breaks into a sardonic smile. "Not unlike the Collapse eh? Must be aliens." $HeOrShe winks. "For sure."

[Line 10468] "Old Earth, mother Terra. From whence we came, long gone. The Luddics aren't completely wrong in their stories. Though, hm, they possess few qualms about 'improving' details to appeal to their quotidian morale framing."
"The historical record is far more complex than that telling, and far more difficult. Far more relatable in the end as well, I believe. Every day we survive by powerful technologies which any one of us barely understands, and which may unleash truly apocalyptic destruction. Mistakes are made, tragedy results; it's only a question of scale."
$HeOrShe considers this for a moment, then begins mumbling a critical response to $hisOrHer own thoughts, "But scale can indeed fundamentally change the quality of phenomena and hence the contextualization of the moral dimension, hmm, quite entirely! Hmm..."

[Line 10469] "Though much of the Persean Sector has been effectively freed from the Domain's technology restrictions - without dismissing the Hegemony's best bloody-minded efforts, of course," $heOrShe gives a half shrug to their efficacy, "-this age has not seen any especially great leaps of technological development. Why not? For the Persean League, or Tri-Tachyon among others, the ban is lifted!"
"Perhaps it is that development of highly complex, advanced technologies requires a stable foundation: a large population base with excess theoretical and engineering capacity, a willingness to devote resources to pursuits beyond mere survival. Or war. And yes, war drives innovation - of a sort. But imagine the possibilities if those billions of credits had not been vaporized alongside so many foolish youths... like those I once knew."
$HeOrShe goes very quiet for a moment. "Those old production chips and nanoforges offer a ladder with the middle rungs missing. We fight to reach toward the top, doomed to fall as the step falters..."

[Line 10470] "The Human Domain split key industries into separate worlds, although yes, with redundancies - set well apart from one another. If one world which produces hyperdrives tried to leverage their specialization against the Domain, well, what good are they without raw materials? Or AM fuel? Or, indeed, the basic necessities of life and access to markets?"
"How can one rebel when the Domain need only control the local Gate to lay a complete siege? Which one world could possibly stand against the entire Domain?" $HeOrShe gives a grim smirk. "Now we're stuck here, besieged by the Domain. There's no one to accept our surrender but some dead Gates."

[Line 10471] "The Galatia Academy? Oh yes, yes, I once attended. And taught there too, if you'll believe it. For quite a few cycles. They figured me as a troublemaker soon enough, but I was slippery. I played the game. Me! Hah, would you believe that?"
$HeOrShe laughs at some old memory. "Made a few enemies too, I did."
"Did you hear who they put in charge of the Academy? Anahita Baird! Can you believe it? The wolf is tending the sheep now, and that's the truth. The Hegemony has no idea what they've done." $HeOrShe cackles, "No idea!"

[Line 10472] "With Baikal Daud in the office of High Hegemon, I can't help but wonder at what mark his administration will make on the 'Phoenix of the Persean Sector'. The old guard still dominate the navy - that's the Eventide contingent. Those families go back to the arrival of the 14th, of course. It's not an old aristocracy by any historical standard, but the pattern is established quickly enough given agreeable conditions. Where was I- yes, Daud. Man of the people. Ruffles feathers. Like when he intervened personally in the Sphinx ensigns scandal. Hegemons simply don't do that! But he's a born leader, none can deny it."
"That's what is really going to get him in trouble," $heOrShe says, then goes quiet, lost in thought.

[Line 10473] "In my circles- that's historians, mind you, not just old folks hanging around the bar," $heOrShe chuckles at $himOrHerself. "We've made a rule not to argue about Artemisia Sun unless legitimate new information appears. And it never does!" $HeOrShe pauses for a moment, tapping $hisOrHer book. "But you're not a historian, so the rule doesn't apply. Wonderful, you get to hear me out!"
"So: Why was she voted off the board just in time for the crucial military disaster of the Second AI War, then able to sweep back into her office with the credibility of all who opposed her absolutely annihilated? Was it merely a ruthless recovery, or was this a calculated sacrifice of Tri-Tachyon assets in order to consolidate her personal power from the start?" $HeOrShe smiles. "Maybe we can hash this theory all the way through one of these days."

[Line 10474] "How we long for some incidental recording of even one of Ludd's supposed speeches or acts. Incredible, is it not, how all evidence of a prophet seems to have disappeared? This, hrm, 'miracle' is of course a point of faith among followers of the Church of Galactic Redemption." 
$HeOrShe raises an eyebrow at you. "It is also, officially, a point of policy for the Hegemony to cooperate with this nonsense in order to appease those Faithful." $HeOrShe furrows $hisOrHer brow in frustration, "As a historian, of course, this vexes me to no end. History as experienced by the common person may be a story society tells itself, and distorted as such. Even still! It must be grounded in fact."
"Of course if I did discover a holovid of Ludd's Trial, some fanatic would try to murder me soon enough for distributing it. Not that I could help myself." $HeOrShe smiles impishly, then considers. "If you do ever find something like that in some old derelict, you'd give me a copy, wouldn't you?"

[Line 10475] "You wouldn't believe how much of my work is built upon cargo manifests. I have a former student working on Agreus; they send me copies lifted off scrapped memory cores. The real secrets are wiped, of course, but the story is all there, in the lines of onloaded and offloaded cargo compared against the hull mass calculations used by navigation to say nothing of the hyperdrive. History is written in logistics!"
"Take for instance the sheer quantity of food and supplies that 'disappear' on trade routes skimming the edge of the Core Worlds. Statistical sampling suggests that a significant percent of all economic activity in the Persean Sector is 'off the books', and a significant portion of that goes straight toward those who are called 'pirates' as well as the so-called 'decivilized' populations... to say nothing of undocumented populations within the Core itself."
The historian leans close, "The official population census of the Persean Sector could be off by as much as an order of magnitude. It's simply astounding." $HeOrShe smiles, and shaking $hisOrHer head.

[Line 10476] "Ah, like I was just telling those young folks over there," the historian waves $hisOrHer hand toward a small group which seems to be avoiding eye contact, "- after the trials of the Cold Passage, the 14th Battlegroup limped across the Persean frontier to discover a sector dominated by the Warlord Leonis. The joint command of the 14th struck down that cruel reign and were hailed as liberators, laying the groundwork for Admiral Kali Molina to make a declaration of Hegemony over the Domain colonies of the Persean Sector with the Eventide Diktat of cycle 49."
"The untarnished Hegemony of that time was too overshadowed by memories of the Domain to truly appreciate the political capital at the High Hegemon's command. Short-term thinking prevailed in anticipation of Gate reactivation. Indeed," $heOrShe puts on a look of sad understanding, "How could they have known that discontinuity would persist for so long, perhaps forever?"

[Line 10477] "Whoever Ludd was, they were not a mere uneducated rabble-rouser. Besides," $heOrShe lowers $hisOrHer voice, "I subscribe to the theory - held by more than a few secular scholars, though quietly, quietly indeed - that Ludd was not one, but many. I would argue that the present format of the Holy Ecumene Council of Archcurates is a reflection of the early Luddic leadership network passed down through history, institutionalized in the early years post-Collapse."
"Heresy, of course. But the truth generally is," $heOrShe says with a smirk.

[Line 10478] "The contemporary form of the Church of Galactic Redemption has proven remarkably stable in spite of, or perhaps because of, the chaotic political arrangement of the Persean Sector immediately post-Collapse."
The historian cradles $hisOrHer hands, unconsciously repeating the old motions of lecturing.
"The Holy Ecumene Council of Archcurates rule on matters of canon, authorize and delegate executive functions, and perform certain exclusive sacraments. However they may be censured and even laicized by a supermajority of the Curates-popular! The members holding those more common positions are ratified by local congregations but must be ordained by an Archcurate in good standing."
$HeOrShe sips some tea, then frowns and looks at $hisOrHer cup as if the tea had gone unexpectedly cold. "Of course, it's rather more complicated than just that in practice..."

[Line 10479] "There are those among the Church of Galactic Redemption - the Luddics, in popular parlance - who hold that the Knights of Ludd are an aberration at odds with the original Luddic vision of the Church. Doubtless true," the historian raises $hisOrHer eyebrows at this small heresy. "An examination of what are agreed by scholars to be among the more authentic passages of the Book of Ludd suggest that themes of militancy and 'a knighthood of the faith' are likely intended as abstract references to a sort of semi-sacral militant volunteerism which would range in practice from a civic protest movement all the way to, arguably, insurrectionism."
"The practical benefit of a standing militant order during the Post-Collapse chaos and following wars must be admitted, however," $heOrShe leans back in $hisOrHer seat, contemplative. "And the most vocal objectors within the Church proper argue that the Knights err by degree rather than in whole. The less vocal objectors? Well, we may not know their thoughts for many, many cycles indeed. The Knights see to that."

[Line 10480] "It is speculated that Admiral Andrada, the self-anointed Supreme Executor of the Sindrian Diktat - or 'Sindrian Mutiny' per the Hegemony viewpoint - is facing a dictator's all-too-common problem of succession. Until now, behind the unified facade of the Diktat, it appears that he has played his major supporters off one another to maintain political stability. Declaring a clear successor would have disrupted this internal balance." 
"And now," the historian speaks slowly, rubbing $hisOrHer chin, "with the cycles' inevitable turn and Andrada in rumored poor health, will he make a surprise announcement to designate an heir? There would be a wave of arrests and, dare I say, executions as those loyal and disloyal to the Executor-apparent are... sorted."
"Or perhaps Andrada has a secret family, or a mind-simulation, or a clone, or some wilder scheme?" $HeOrShe barks a laugh. "Speculation on this point seems to say as much about the speculator as about anything Andrada is thinking. I should ask you for some insight!" $HeOrShe laughs again.

[Line 10481] "If Philip Andrada, the self-anointed Supreme Executor of the Sindrian Diktat, were the strategic mastermind he was claimed to be - first by Hegemony propaganda and then his own - then why then did he not simply sweep the Persean Sector in a conquest to rival his greatest vanquished foe, the Warlord Loke?"
"Well!" The historian raises a finger like an orator, then, thinking better of it, lets $hisOrHer hand drop to the table. "Matters abound! Andrada took a portion - but only a portion - of the Hegemony navy in the course of his mutiny. He took possession of the Askonia system and was immediately faced with the catastrophic consequences of the Opis incident, ongoing rebellion, complete lack of logistics, and the pressing need to maintain a credible military force against a vengeful Hegemony. And, indeed, all of this while fulfilling the expectations of key supporters!" 
"The true testament to Andrada's genius may well lie in his scheme not immediately collapsing in upon itself!"

[Line 10482] "The culture of transient interstellar starship crew and infrastructure workers - "spacers", if you like - has become particularized in the era post-Collapse. Rather than existing in vast diffusion across the Human Domain as a mere statistical category, impossibly detached and undistinguished, they've been localized to the Persean Sector and now form a critical mass of intra-cultural contact out of which distinct commonalities arise."
$HeOrShe takes a moment to catch $hisOrHer breath before proceeding. "Indeed, the majority of interstellar logistics have shifted from Gate to hyperspace journeys. Spacers bear everyday witness now to the ruins of the Collapse and AI Wars. These journeys are haunted," $heOrShe takes on a jovially grim tone. "Haunted, one might say, by history. Indeed, one might suggest that Spacer culture has become quite superstitious in the last two hundred cycles."
$HeOrShe trails off, letting a breath go, looking upward toward unseen stars. "The great dark filled with death and mystery as never before," $heOrShe says, quoting something.

[Line 10483] "Old Mairaath, the center of the old Mayasuran stellar polity, was primed to blossom as a shining beacon of culture and civilization in the Persean Sector, a light to outshine Opis perhaps, once the terraforming came into true fruition."
"Both those lights are extinguished, now," the historian says gloomily. "I suppose they lacked the hard-hearted military-industrial alignment of the Hegemony's Eventide-Chicomoztoc axis, to say nothing of Kazeron and its League. And so on, for the rest of them."
"The worst of us thrive in these violent times, it seems." $HeOrShe seems to realize in the moment who $heOrShe is speaking to and adds, without conviction, "Uh, present company excluded, of course."  

[Line 10484] "What precisely the Hegemony does with the 'forbidden' AI confiscated by its technological inspectors, particularly during the post-AI Wars crackdowns, is not - yet - a matter of historical record. And unlikely to ever be, if COMSEC has their way," $heOrShe says bitterly. 
"Obviously," $heOrShe continues, "the Hegemony is more conservative in exploitation of AI relative to the Domain at its height. The grumblings of the Luddic population ring loud in any Hegemon's ears, and Baikal Daud knows better than to spark unrest under the present peace-of-compromise."
"Now that said," the historian leans closer, lowering $hisOrHer voice, "The paranoid provide entertaining speculations. One theory tells of secret overminds hidden in far-off planetoids simulating worlds which hold in thrall the minds of billions of bio-suspended human slaves; cruel scenarios playing out in the sick imagination of uncaring AI-gods. Nonsense, of course," $heOrShe smiles reassuringly. "What purpose would such mistreatment serve?"

[Line 10485] "Those who awake from cryosleep who were laid to rest in the time of the Domain are perhaps the most lost of all. Many, though not all, imagined they would populate the far end of a rich frontier; they accepted that they would leave behind all they once knew. Now they all find themselves cut loose from all reference, unmoored in history."
"And who is to care for them? Certainly the Luddics suggest the comfort of their religion. Others take up drink or drugs, or nihilistic detachment which too-often spills outward into destruction. Not a few of the most brutal pirates are former sleepers, you know."
"Where records persist, sleepers who are uniquely skilled are sometimes... recruited, drafted - 'kidnapped' is perhaps the word - by parties seeking insight into some old tech or lost secrets." A troubled look crosses $hisOrHer face. "I admit that if I could, I would arrange for the systematic interview of the sleepers. They would prove an excellent resource to our pre-Collapse histories, provided we keep a realistic understanding of the limitations of first-hand sources."

[Line 10486] "I find myself with a growing affinity for the developing itinerant spacer culture," $heOrShe gestures to the patrons around you. "They have developed a colorful milieu, worldview, and even a shared mythology."
"Although," $heOrShe leans in, "on a personal level, I cannot but wonder if something of the world itself has changed since the Collapse. Has hyperspace become more chaotic, mysterious; inhabited, almost, by alien phenomena? Or was it simply unobserved, or unreported before? Or were the reports suppressed? Or was there simply not enough intra-spacer contact to reinforce their observations - or shall we put it, for the skeptical -  these shared narrative projections?"
"I am a mere historian and, now," $heOrShe smiles sadly, "I am bereft of the corrective presence of my colleagues in the Academy. I both fear and admit that my documentation efforts might appear to drift toward dilettantism."

[Line 10487] "The mind reels at the loss of the Collapse," $heOrShe says. "Set aside even the Domain for a moment, with its population inconceivable to our barely-civilized human brains. Just the fringe world of the Persean Sector witnessed untold death as the thin thread of logistics from the Core, and the Domain itself, was cut. Food, life support, medicines, essential machinery - bled out, spilled into space to become so much debris..."
The historian stares off into a corner, $hisOrHer eyes darkened, $hisOrHer attention become lost in the imagined scene of past horror.

[Line 10488] "Ah, the tragedy of Opis. The sheer scale of loss is incomprehensible to the mind. To this day there are those who fight and kill over the finer points of whose fault it was. I have my position, but that argument over-dominates the story of the Opisean polity itself. Why should those countless dead be defined by their murderer? I find that the beginning of a story is necessary to illuminate the end, don't you agree?"
$HeOrShe doesn't wait for an answer, but begins to lecture. "Opis was a center of population, of art and commerce. Not heavy industry as-such, however - that they exported to Sindria; and agriculture, to Volturn. Out of sight, out of mind. The rulers of the Chartery of Opis grew to see little need in appeasing any but their local patronage networks. Wealth flowed to the center, where influence coagulated; the edges were forgotten."
"Was it once again the sin of the Domain re-enacted on a smaller stage?" $HeOrShe raises $hisOrHer eyebrows.

[Line 10489] "This?" $HeOrShe pats the paper book $heOrShe keeps close, and consults often. "It is... something of an affectation fitting with my self-image."
"There are independent high-tech manufacturers of such objects which range far from traditional papermaking. The integrated digital interface paper-analogs are impressively functional, but my own notebooks? I purchase them from a Luddic craft guild on Tartessus. Indeed, it is mostly composed of dead cellulose."
"I do produce digital backups," $heOrShe admits. "It is not in keeping with full faith in the spirit of the material, but the archivist and researcher in me cannot abide the risk of losing my notes."

[Line 10564] [Option Selected: Get back up]
Local MuniSec holds you, your guards, and a few witnesses until a mid-rank Knight of Ludd can make a ruling on the situation. The case for self-defense is clear-cut - witnesses swear holy oaths to this - and the licensing of your protective weapons is accepted.
"A child, led astray," the Knight says gruffly as the would-be assassin is wrapped in a simple shroud and taken away. Their eyes turn to you, "Your pride sows wrath, and it bears this bloody fruit."
After a pointed silence, they say, "You and yours; go now. What's here is done."
"...So I pray," the Knight mutters as you turn away.

Your salvors spread out through the $nameInText in teams under the gruff direction of your Ops Chief. Salvage is rapidly identified, assessed, logged, and tagged with trackers, when appropriate, for follow-up teams to extract.
Computers and datastores are accessed via disposable interfacers, rough and quick hardware jobs that send back any information they can lift from poorly shielded databanks. Back on your $shipOrFleet, your tech teams crack security and decrypts anything they can, forwarding useful information - maps, cargo manifests, engineering diagrams - back to the salvors to use.

These teams are experts at rapidly reconstructing the relevant events of a starship or space station's demise; such a narrative provides useful information about dangers and valuables.
Here, comms logs and surveillance gives meaning to the evidence of scattered damage caused by light firearms - local security was in the process of a major crackdown on a drug smuggling operation, and in an explosive confrontation appears to have caused a blowout of the primary hab section. This seems to have tipped the state of the station, already precarious, into a full evacuation.
The rest of the story is mere salvage for your waiting holds.

Your salvors fan out through the station, discovering makeshift barricades around the access tubes to the executive and security modules. There's interior combat damage caused by handheld weapons, many of which appear to have been adapted from mining tools. A strike turned deadly.
The security forces employed riot-suppression armaments at first, then rapidly escalated to their cache of "vac-safe" weapons intended for boarding and infantry action within ship hulls or station modules. 
The miners appear to have responded by up-armoring standard haz suits, adding breastplates worked from mining drones' blast panels, slotted visors cut from rolls of nuke-rated anti-spall sheeting, and much other imaginative makeshift panoply.

With the tides turning against them once more, security forces fought a break-out action toward central life support.
Successful, they choked off atmo and water to those modules held by the strikers. This won the fight, if the heavily armored but nonetheless desiccated corpses floating through the corridors have anything to say about it, but the war was still lost.
The station appears to have been abandoned as-is, too much of a scandal to reactivate or, perhaps, merely a write-off.

Your salvors discover that comms and anti-collision weapon emplacements have been deliberately destroyed by careful strikes.
Closer examination shows evidence that a pirate ship docked - the brutal hull markings and garish paint job of the gutted hulk are a giveaway - but was completely disabled in the cargo bay by some kind of makeshift explosive adapted from on-hand mining equipment.
Their plundering mothership destroyed, the remaining pirates - operating a handful of light frigates and a wing of fighters - appear to have taken out their anger by strafing the station's hab modules and life support before going on their way.
The few miners who survived the immediate attack were doomed to a slow death.

One particular module of this research station appears to have been a bioweapons laboratory. The lab is - rather, was - hermetically sealed, and contains the ruins of state-of-the-art containment and decontamination facilities.
Naturally, something went terribly wrong. 
And as your techies analyze telemetry and what raw surveillance buffers the salvors on-station are able to transmit back to your $shipOrFleet, the disaster begins to look distinctly unnatural.

"Sabotage," your ops chief mutters darkly.
The patchy surveillance shows a rapid spread of violent, painful demise beginning in atmospheric processing and spreading outward at the speed of fresh air through atmo conduits, tripping the broad-spectrum biohazard sensors one by one as the agent suffused through the station. But no alarm sounded for human ears.
Your salvage chief orders all remaining pockets of atmo purged, and strict quarantine procedures followed.
The bioweapons lab's computer core destroyed itself with a small bomb when a timed dead man's switch was not reset, so nothing of salable value remains, if indeed a buyer could be found for whatever biochemical horror was conjured here.

Salvor teams cut through fused locks and infiltrate the station. They find researchers, administrators, technicians down to the lowliest access-tunnel scrubber at their work-stations, or near enough. Quite dead, however. And even those who remained in pockets of viable atmo are surprisingly undecayed.
Their end was not pleasant, but it appears to have at least been very, very quick.
Your salvors and tech teams assemble evidence to reconstruct the event: a massive radiation pulse centered on Experiment Module B, which, judging from the gap between the ruins of Modules A and C, was almost entirely vaporized by the event.

Your tech officer shakes their head, showing characteristic frustration at having their curiosity unfulfilled.
No relevant monitoring and computer system from Module B survived, and the general practice of this station appears to have involved heavy siloing of information even up to the level of the executive command section, so it's impossible to say what exactly the research being pursued involved or, indeed, whether the event was an accident or something more sinister.

Although superficially intact, salvor teams soon find evidence of light weapons fire and the resulting carnage, thankfully long desiccated, decayed, and/or frozen depending on the run-down time of life support in any particular sector. 
The seemingly random spread and directionlessness of the violence suggests that the security systems of this station turned on its occupants all at once. The catastrophic results were not helped by the unusually strong internal security measures: hidden autoturrets set to kill, powered lockdown curtains which indiscriminately scissored obstructions, and nests of mobile suppression drones which could traverse small conduits and air ducts to find and "neutralize" any survivors.
Thankfully, the last of these measures has long run out of power.

A precise decapitation strike appears to have targeted the command and control module of this station, likely a clutch of military-grade torpedoes unleashed at close range by an unsuspected vessel.
Security systems were tight and highly hierarchical; once the central C&C went down, automatic lockdown procedures trapped the occupants of the station in their sections - habitation, labs, research, recreation, life support, cargo handling, storage, engineering, cooling, and so on.
Now each is a locked tomb preserving evidence of the final hours, sometimes days, of the occupants.

Upon entry, your salvors discover first one, then many of the same portrait adorning the interior sections of the hab. Smashed busts line the primary reception concourse. Above all stood a statue of the selfsame likeness churned out of a simple rock-foam fabricator, polished, and gilded; it now lies face-planted into the deckplates, the gilding half-stripped.
All bear the face of a strong-jawed man who looks down upon the empty halls and dead plazas of the hab, his gaze fatherly; stern, and proud. And in all cases defaced: the nose smashed off, crude words painted or, more often, burnt across his image.
Even his name, whatever it was, has been erased from every databank by a spitefully determined noise-wipe virus.

[Line 10708] [Option Selected: Explore the ruins]
A close approach by salvor teams shows a heat source, and glint of artificial light. An anomalous pocket of operational life-support, the emergency subsection backup of a backup somehow running for tens, hundreds of cycles? It is unlikely.
Your officers always perform the standard transponder pings at the start of a salvage operation; it is part of the ritual of legal salvage (though records of legality are fabricated easily enough, when required, and doing a good job of it is a sign of respect appreciated by customs officers across the Persean Sector).
It would be awkward to stumble into some hermit's cell, ideologue's oubliette, or pirate holdfast unannounced, so your comms officer takes charge of a new signalling attempt with a full range of communication protocols, from an overpowered standard holo-link to mere radio, laser staccato, and even an esoteric grav-pulse relay.

An acoustic inducer-transponder, normally used in mining surveys, is tenderly attached to the hab's structure by a discreet remote probe. It thuds out a code, and detects only a tiny, noisy, rhythmic vibration in return. Something tapping on the hullplate with slow, clock-like regularity.

A tiny garden grows wild within this celestial tomb. Some kind of fissile backup battery has survived, clicking away the decay of heavy elements to heat and light a tiny bubble of life. Moisture condenses in a murky lens of slush on a hubward window, then falls slowly in huge drops through the micro-g of the habitat's spin, past the glowplates, toward the mosses and molds and tiny flowers growing on the warm heaps of droppings and husks of vermin.
On a life-giving terran world, this would be nothing more than a dank pit. Here, it is a miracle.

How old must it be, thousands of cycles?
If you had been asked a shift ago, your reasonable reply would have been to call it a myth. The Onslaught Mk.I could easily be a just-so founding narrative element of the Human Domain, a story about united struggle and hardship against an implacable Other with a shiny bit of military kit in center stage. An imagined avatar of the empire's holy trinity: military, industry, gate system.
Yet here that avatar appears, unbelievably far and wayward from the heart of the Human Domain - or even what was once the Domain's frontiers a thousand cycles ago.
Your ops chief, unperturbed, looks to you for confirmation. Words are unneeded, the question is clear: send in the salvors?

Fevered analysis proceeds. In the midst of what appears to be structured noise buried in the analog waveform - datasets which are insensible without context - analysis teams discover a set of coordinates; a position at some distance from the small gravity well you're orbiting in archaic but parseable Domain astrogation units. The message still repeats itself.

Bafflingly crude automation is wormed throughout the ship, whispering to itself. Interfaces are built on familiar fundamental principles, but aesthetically red-shifted, seeming from an alien culture.
What records remain are damaged where they aren't missing entirely. The logs tell of aeons of war in the darkness between the stars. Human crew in and out of cryo, continually diminished, replaced by the augmented wounded, then the cyborg rebuilds, and then, and then... this exhausted humming, clicking thing threaded throughout the ship.

A datastore reference leads to blocks of information decayed by time. But the reconstruction algorithms leap into action and, despite troublingly low reliability ratings, sew together a set of files. 
Patch notes.
The hardware specs are arcane, the software obtuse and plagued by null library calls, but the common language of human mathematics sketches out the intent. There, your technology officer's team assembles a new spec of the sensor modifications required to detect this "Threat".
Adapting these requirements on your relatively modern systems is a far easier task than the labors described by the ancients.

"$PlayerSirOrMadam, I'm not sure it's working." Your sensors officer speaks, standing at a control console to demonstrate a first test of the adaptations. Line after line is dumped into an output log.
The characters sprout and repeat. Your technology officer's face is underlit by their glow.

A man appears. The resolution is poor, the audio patchy. It appears that he didn't pay for premium-grade transmission and caching.
"Ahem. Yes, hello? I assume that icon means it's recording."
He clears his throat, turning to fully face the imager.

Academician Cornelius Elek appears before you. The resolution is poor, the audio patchy. It appears that he didn't pay for premium-grade transmission and caching.

He clears his throat, turning to fully face the imager.

"I am Academician Cornelius Elek." He waits a moment to allow his name to sink in.

"You may have heard of my seminal work, 'A New Survey of Planetology on the Fringe of the Persean Sector' which achieved a new standard for the field, if I may say so, despite tepid reactions from certain of my narrow-minded colleagues. Now, as I was saying..."
His self-important speech is as droning as you recall from your previous conversation, when you returned a planetology datacore to the Academy.

[Line 10753] [Options Given: gaDHO_hook2:Continue]

[Line 10754] [Option Selected: Continue]
So this is Cornelius Elek. 
You recall discussing him with Alviss Sebestyen when you returned a planetology datacore to the Galatia Academy for a reward. Sebestyen wouldn't say it outright, but it seems that Elek is a man who tends toward a certain amount of interpersonal friction.
Judging by the self-important delivery of this speech, this is that same Elek.

[Line 10754] [Options Given: gaDHO_hook2:Continue]

[Line 10755] [Option Selected: Continue]
He pauses a moment, probably to evoke gravitas.
"It is my desire that this missive finds you receptive, Captain..."
Elek glances down, reading from a datapad.
"$PlayerName. It has been strongly emphasized to me by... a patron of the sciences who has seen fit to fund my work that you are the perfect facilitator to the solution of an old mystery I found in the archives. I-"
He squints again at something on his datapad, then says under his breath "Is that the cost per second? Stars above!"

[Line 10755] [Options Given: gaDHO_hook3:Continue]

[Line 10756] [Option Selected: Continue]
Elek clears his throat again, then speaks quickly.
"In summary, my patron offers a vast fortune in credits for services which I shall be pleased to enumerate in detail upon your visit to my offices at the Galatia Academy, which may be found in orbit of P-" 
The message cuts off.

[Line 10756] [Options Given: gaDHO_hook4:Continue]

[Line 10757] [Option Selected: Continue]
He may sound like a pompous, out-of-touch academic, but if Elek is telling the truth about a 'vast fortune', it might be worthwhile to hear him out.

[Line 10758] [Option Selected: Continue]
He sounds as pompous as ever, but if Elek is telling the truth about a 'vast fortune', it might be worthwhile to hear him out. He did, after all, pay out the reward for his datacore.

[Line 10761] [Option Selected: Ask where you could find the office of Cornelius Elek]
A strange expression crosses the junior agent's face at your question, but it is instantly replaced by a return to bland pleasantness.
"Of course, captain. I presume you have an appointment? Academician Elek can be... busy."

[Line 10761] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekStart3:"He sent me a personal invitation."]

[Line 10762] [Option Selected: Ask where you could find the office of Cornelius Elek]

"Of course, $playerSirOrMadam," the agent says. "If you'll come right this way."
You are led through the station's primary transport hub and are soon deposited in airy plaza halfway around the ring of the station. Your junior agent leads you through crowds of students and past a few tight-lipped academicians who scurry by, clutching datapads.
The junior agent fills the air with the sort of patter they must have saved for first-cycle students, pointing out landmarks and remarking upon departments and figures of interest to niche fields of study.

[Line 10763] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekStart4:Continue]

[Line 10764] [Option Selected: Continue]
You arrive in a quiet hall off the main concourse, only a couple decks above the station rim. An open volume ringed by railings provides a dizzying view of the clouds of Pontus 'below' you.
"Third door on the right, $playerSirOrMadam." The junior agent makes a tight smile then disappears.

[Line 10764] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElek:Enter]

[Line 10765] [Option Selected: Enter]
A man in academician's robes is buried in a holodisplay. Several moons appear to orbit his head.
"What have I told you hooligans about office hours?" he shouts out. "They don't start until-" 
He finally looks and realizes you aren't one of his students. 
"Ah." He adopts a look of stern prognostication, cradling his hands together as glowing orbs circle above. "I suppose greetings are in order. I am Academician Cornelius Elek, senior vice-chair of the Planetology Department of the Galatia Academy."
"And you are?"

[Line 10766] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekIntro2:"I'm $playerName. We've spoken before. I returned your datacore."]

[Line 10768] [Option Selected: "I'm $playerName. You invited me to see you."]
Elek stares at you, the spark of recognition failing to ignite.
"I'm afraid I don't recall," he says. "What, may I ask, is the purpose of your visit?"

[Line 10768] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekIntro3:"You sent a message about doing a job."
gaDHO_visitElekIntro3c:"You sent a message about 'an old mystery'. I'd like to help solve it."
gaDHO_visitElekIntro3b:"You sent me a message. I was interested in the 'vast fortune'."]

[Line 10771] [Option Selected: "You sent a message about doing a job."]
"Oh yes, of course. You should have simply said so."
He rushes out of his holodisplay to pick up a datapad, then places himself behind a large desk, waving you toward a chair. Unfortunately it is occupied by a battered datacore, the sort used in long-range probes.
"Now then," he taps at his datapad, failing to notice your obstacle.
"The mystery concerns a very old dataset which has been in the Galatia Academy archives for somewhat more than two hundred cycles. I stumbled upon it in the course of my studies - well, in fact, I was discussing the old archives with... a friend, a wealthy patron of the sciences. A comment they made reminded me of its existence."

[Line 10771] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekIntro4:Remain standing]

[Line 10772] [Option Selected: Remain standing]
"As it happens, this dataset is a recording of telemetry from a Domain-era sensor array out on what we now call the Fringe. It was somewhat more civilized back when this data was captured, though not perhaps by much."
Elek chuckles softly at his wit.
"As for the dataset, we only really have a complete sourcing header. Our copy is mostly corrupted due to anomalous  degradation during hyperwave transmission and then over 200 cycles of low-priority storage."
He shakes his head with deep disappointment at the mistakes made by someone else.

He either doesn't notice or doesn't acknowledge your signal.

He snaps out of his reverie and looks at the chair.
"So it does," he says. "Please don't touch it."

[Line 10775] [Option Selected: Remain standing;['gaDHO_visitElekIntro5b'];['gaDHO_visitElekIntro5c']]
"In any event," Elek cradles his hands, looking into an imagined middle-distance. "This patron and, ah, friend offered to fund a project to recover an intact copy of the data."
"From the source." He smiles, quite pleased with himself. "An expedition shall be made to the original sensor array! Your name came up, captain."

[Line 10775] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekIntro7:"Find the sensor array, extract the data. Sounds simple."]

[Line 10776] [Option Selected: "Find the sensor array, extract the data. Sounds simple."]
"When put like that, yes." He stands, placing his hands together behind his back, and begins pacing.
"I shall provide you with a scientific hardware package my students have prepared. It is far from simple, I assure you of that! Have your technicians attach it to the sensor array and it will carry out the necessary operations."
"That's not all, however." He pauses to look at you with a sly smile.

[Line 10776] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekIntro8:"Oh?"
gaDHO_visitElekIntro8b:"I haven't agreed to anything yet, Elek."]

[Line 10777] [Option Selected: "I haven't agreed to anything yet, Elek."]

"I propose that once you acquire the data and my algorithm extracts the targeting coordinates, you then travel to the indicated location which lies at the heart of all of this effort. Explore what is to be explored, find what is to be found. You will bring back no mere long-range scan, but a thorough investigation!"
"Think of the science, think of the glory! And," he winks, "You must be thinking of that 'vast fortune'. I do believe that Director Gla... that my 'friend' will be more than delighted by this fait accompli."

[Line 10789] [Option Selected: "In your message, you mentioned a reward. The words 'vast fortune' were used."]
"Indeed," He looks at you brightly. "Though I'm certain mere credits shall pale in comparison to the illumination of the unknown. Knowledge, after all, is the greatest treasure."
Elek waves a hand, "Don't misunderstand me. I may be a man whose domain is of the mind, but I appreciate that those such as yourself have baser concerns. Trust that you will be rewarded! This project is funded by an excellent patron of the sciences for whom I vouch for quite entirely."

[Line 10790] [Option Selected: "I didn't get a clear answer about this reward. How much is it?"]

His mouth shuts and he looks intently at you. Hoping that you didn't hear the obvious. 

[Line 10796] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekHubSelA5a:"Tri-Tachyon is backing your project?"
gaDHO_visitElekHubSelA5b:"Glad to hear it. I expect more than 100,000 credits, plus hazard."]

He rolls his eyes and lets out a long sigh.
"Fine, fine. I'm... sure it won't be a problem. Probably."
"That's a lot of credits." He looks at you accusingly. "It should be spent on primary research, not gilding rocket ships, but." He holds up a hand, as if to contain the outburst he presumes will come. "I will hold my tongue. If the expedition is as much of a success as I believe it will be, the dear price shall be worth it."

[Line 10800] [Option Selected: "I won't work for Tri-Tachyon."]

He holds up a hand, as if to contain the outburst he presumes will come. "I shall hold my tongue, and so will you.

[Line 10805] [Option Selected: "Who exactly is this 'friend' of yours?"]
"Mm," he frowns, carefully maintaining a thoughtful expression.
"They have asked me not to reveal their identity. I believe, if anything, the humility they show in not taking public credit for their contributions to this great academy - and my department in particular - are a sign of dedication to pure scientific advancement. Truly, it is a noble undertaking."

Despite your attempt at winning his favor, he's lost the thread and taken a whole new course. Eventually he drifts off into what looks like thoughtful silence.

[Line 10807] [Option Selected: "As I am key to this expedition, I'd like to know more of your patron and my benefactor."]
"A not unreasonable request," Elek says, making a show of thinking over your words.
"You will, after all, be bound bodily to the project more than any other, even if you do not possess the theoretical background to fully understand its importance. I suppose it is the least I could do. After all, girding with knowing of the greater purposes you serve might enhance and embolden your spirit of exploration..."

[Line 10808] [Option Selected: Nod enthusiastically as if you are entranced by his words]
Something breaks in his expression.
"Zunya Glamor-Rotanev, the Director of Special Acquisitions for the Tri-Tachyon corporation, in fact, is the patron of my project. She is a woman of great vision, far greater than I would have expected from such a lofty position in an ostensibly profit-driven enterprise."
"By revealing this to you, captain, I am trusting in your discretion," he says with a solemn nod.

[Line 10809] [Option Selected: "Why is this data so important? What did this sensor array find?"]
"An excellent question." Elek taps at his datapad, and turns toward his holodisplay.
The spinning moons have disappeared to be replaced by a map of the Persean Sector, a broad swath of stars. The Core Worlds are highlighted, the fringe stars somewhat dimmed.
"Here you see - or do not see, for it is in the crudest sense a sort of absence - the Orion-Persean Abyss. It is far from a nothingness, however. And it is that not-nothingness with which we are concerned."

gaDHO_visitElekHubSelC2b:"Aren't you a planetologist? This seems outside your field."]

[Line 10810] [Option Selected: "So... there's something in the Abyss."]
"Correct, dear captain!" Elek sounds pleased that you have followed the trajectory of his lesson.
"There are indeed planets to be found there. Cold, dark, and alone; bereft of their parent stars, flung into the sparse wastes between the arms of our galaxy."

[Line 10811] [Option Selected: "Aren't you a planetologist? This seems outside your field."]
"Pah," Elek waves a dismissal.
"I shan't fully enumerate the errors in your statement. It is enough that there are indeed planets to be found there. Cold, dark, and alone; bereft of their parent stars, flung into the sparse wastes between the arms of our galaxy."

[Line 10812] "I theorize that it is one of these planets our sensor array was targeting."
His tone grows less heated. "Or, rather, an unknown energetic event involving or concerning one such planet. We are not certain exactly which, however, and it is exceedingly difficult - and expensive - to perform any kind of broad analysis of these wayward children from afar. And with our sadly reduced means compared to the grand days of the old Domain... alas, alack."

[Line 10813] [Option Selected: "I accept."]
"Excellent. I'll have the hardware package transferred to your $shipOrFleet immediately," he taps at a datapad, connecting comms and reels off some imperious orders at some poor support staff.
"Off you go! We made the package installation idiot-proof. So I'm sure you...r technicians will be capable of installing it."

gaDHO_visitElekAccept2b:"Wait, which end goes in the sensor array again?"]

"I see. You're engaging in a bit of jocularity. Well, I can't exactly disapprove of high spirits at the outset of the expedition provided you mind the technical details."
He turns back to his holodisplay and begins re-arranging moons. "I await your return, captain," he says over his shoulder.

"What? Don't be ridiculous," Elek huffs irritably. "Take the time to think it through, captain. I'm sure reason will win out eventually."
"Or, at least, greed," he says more quietly as he turns back to his holodisplay in a huff and begins arranging moons, a clear indication that he believes the conversation is over.

Your sensors officer casts the visual output to the primary bridge display. It is all struts and masses and harsh geometric shadows - then with a flash, a LIDAR overlay reveals the structure in the light of a false day.
A section near the center flashes at Sensor's prompting. There- a small workframe has been attached to the central processing module, a clutch of equipment cases spewing wires and cables outward like a parasitic growth.

Your ops chief deploys salvors with caution bordering on paranoia despite all appearances of this arrangement being of standard civilian parts. If it's pirates seeking a detection advantage, it would be customary for the arrangement to be trapped, and your ops chief's custom to oversee their disarming with seeming ease.
Each check is made, each movement coordinated with your sensors officer to ensure there are no surprises. The salvor teams look for everything from crude chemical bombs set off by millimeter-thin thermal detector patches to invisible thresholds of exotic physics which surround certain advanced technologies that might have been plundered from some old Domain cache.
Everything goes quiet for a moment. Ops taps a console, then turns to you.

Ops orders a start to the real work now. A senior salvage technician boots up a small, cheap interfacer which they hold out on a simple telescoping pole to probe the mod-hardware control system. Telemetry pours into the isolated computing environment set up by your technology officer's team, and they begin to interpret the results.
"Well, we think it's from the Galatia Academy," Tech says, eyes on an expanding visual model of the computing environment.

"It says 'property of the Galatia Academy Planetology Department by the authority of Academician Cornelius Elek..." their words drift off as the tech team's finding begin to coalesce into comprehensible patterns.
 
The story comes together: this old sensor array scanned a broad swath of the Abyss for very particular signatures over 200 cycles ago. Someone installed this new hardware quite recently, and it extracted that data from the sensor array's buffers, processed it using a clever suite of algorithms concocted as, presumably, the thesis project of some bright student of the Galatia Academy.

Academician Cornelius Elek. A somewhat self-important man, as you recall. You found his datacore on some inner Fringe planet and received the reward authorized by Provost Kallichore for your trouble.

The story comes together as Tech assembles the pieces: this sensor array scanned a broad swath of the Abyss for very particular signatures over 200 cycles ago. This hardware found that data in the sensor array's buffers, processed it with a clever suite of algorithms concocted as, presumably, the thesis project of some bright student of the Galatia Academy.
No one ever came back to collect the data.

[Line 10940] [Options Given: gaDHO_justFoundArray4:"What was Elek looking for and what this find?"]

[Line 10941] [Option Selected: "What was Elek looking for and what this find?"]
"There's no, ah, obvious indication of what exactly they were looking for," Tech reports. "It's all... complex self-modifying algorithms. A series of energetic events at a certain location, perhaps?"
"But," they say, trying to find the good news in this mess, "it did find what it was looking for. There's a raw data buffer output with coordinates attached for what the modified processor claims is... some kind of rogue planet in the Abyss. Just a lone rock, no star, no other primary."

[Line 10941] [Options Given: gaDHO_justFoundArray5:"Some nameless rock, huh. Let's have the coordinates."]

[Line 10942] [Option Selected: "Some nameless rock, huh. Let's have the coordinates."]
"$PlayerSirOrMadam." They tap a few commands and release a data-packet from the isolated computing environment to your personal datapad.
You have the coordinates for... something. Something that someone thought was important 200 cycles in the past. And that Cornelius Elek thought was important much more recently.
You could either go in blind to find out what's out there, or go to the Galatia Academy to see if this Academician Cornelius Elek has some kind of explanation.

"Would you be so good as to transfer the data you collected? It is very valuable." He picks up his datapad and taps at it, then looks at you pointedly. "Um. Valuable to science, that is. Abstract knowledge, not much use to the likes of... to freelancers like yourself, I should say."

"Yes? Very well, do elaborate." He places his hands together in a well-practiced pose of attentive contemplation, though his impatience shines through quite unambiguously.
You tell Elek about finding the sensor array, processing the data, then travelling into the Abyss. Elek nods along, fascinated enough to only interrupt occasionally to correct some pedantic detail or other.

"You're a heartless mercenary with no appreciation for science," Elek says, his tone growing heated.
"You'd never have found... whatever you found... without me!" He seems to realize in the moment how weak this sounds, and recomposes himself.
"This is practically piracy, you know."

He takes a deep breath and looks at you for a long time. He begins, but does not speak as he thinks better of it once, twice. You can see the anger in his eyes.
But you hold the data.
How many cycles of his academic career has he invested already? How many more will he get out of these results? He is a man of science, of reason. And of pride. But can he set it aside for a few minutes?

"Out, get out of my office!" he shouts. "I'll call security!"
He continues shouting, and you see heads appear at the door then quickly duck away. It seems you've pushed him too far; there is no reasoning with him in this state.

[Line 10999] The only way forward is to investigate the coordinates in the Abyss yourself.

[Line 11000] It is unsurprising that an ivory torus academician like Elek would lack an appreciation for your need for compensation to reward undertaking a hazardous mission, but so it goes. He is unlikely to reveal the motivation behind his project to analyze the particular sensor array which was looking at the location of the Onslaught Mk.I.
Elek can't have acted alone. Someone knew where to look.

"Ah," he tears his eyes from the datapad.
"It's a mystery surrounding a very old dataset which has been in the Galatia Academy archives for a very long time. I stumbled upon it in the course of my studies - I was discussing the breadth of the archives with... a friend, a wealthy patron of the sciences, in fact. A comment they made reminded me of this half-corrupted enigma..."

"...And that dataset consisted of telemetry from a Domain-era sensor array out on what we now call the Fringe. It was somewhat more civilized back when the data was captured, though not perhaps by much."
Elek chuckles softly at his wit.
"As for the data, only the sourcing header is intact. Our copy is mostly corrupted due to anomalous  degradation during hyperwave transmission followed by 200 cycles of low-priority storage."

[Line 11008] "But your copy," he smiles, "is complete! Um," he taps at his datapad for a moment. "Mostly, anyway. Significantly more than the old one. This is a fabulous find!"

[Line 11009] "But if I'm right," he smiles, "your copy of the data is uncorrupted! Um, theoretically, anyway." He taps at his datapad for a moment, opening a datastream.

He sighs, then softens his tone. "But, yes, the logic of our economic arrangements dictate that scientific service ought be compensated."
A datapad appears in his hands and he taps something on, a little harder than strictly necessary. "I shall pay you 50,000 credits for recovering the data. Rather generous, I think."

"That's sheer piracy! I'll offer 75,000 and not a credit more, $playerSirOrMadam," he says, growing heated.

[Line 11022] [Option Selected: "So what is at those coordinates in the Abyss?]
"Well." He pauses to make a thoughtful expression.
"That's a complex question to answer. The data," he manipulates his datapad, pulling up charts and diagrams in his large holodisplay, "It provides the opportunity for many interpretations, often contradictory..."
He proceeds like this with little sign of stopping. It's soon clear to you that he doesn't know.

[Line 11023] [Option Selected: "My people say it's pointing at a rock in the Abyss. Something happened there."]
"-Yes, of course." You see a flash of annoyance as his lecture is interrupted, but Elek manages to adjust to a new line of discourse.
"A rogue planet, a singular celestial body bereft of a stellar primary - or any other, for that matter. Cold, dark, and alone; bereft of parent star, flung into the sparse wastes between the arms of our galaxy."
"There are many such bodies although, unfortunately, we only rarely have the opportunity to study them closely these days..."
He begins speaking at length on the study of rogue planets.

"I didn't say I- it's a, presumably, unexplored-" Elek is caught off-balance again. "The point is..."
He sighs, surrendering a small battle.
"It was... my friend, the patron of the sciences. Given their, ah, extreme wealth and interest in acting as a sponsor of pure discovery, they had the notion to fund an expedition to solve my little mystery. I thought it was a capital notion! All was arranged. Then, of course... and you found... well." 
He goes quiet, finally.

[Line 11024] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekAltWrapup3:"Who is your patron? If they're so wealthy, I'm sure I've heard of them."
gaDHO_visitElekAltWrapup3z:"Are you sure your patron is only interested in pure discovery?"]

[Line 11025] [Option Selected: "Are you sure your patron is only interested in pure discovery?"]
"Most certainly!" he sputters, "She assured me, at length, and despite her position in Tri-"
His mouth shuts and he looks intently at you. Hoping that you didn't hear the obvious.

[Line 11025] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekAltWrapupTT2a:"I shall say nothing, of course."
gaDHO_visitElekAltWrapupTT2b:"Tri-Tachyon is backing your project?"]

[Line 11026] [Option Selected: "Who is your patron? If they're so wealthy, I'm sure I've heard of them."]
"Mm," he frowns, carefully recomposing an expression of lofty erudition.
"They have asked me not to reveal their identity. I believe, if anything, the humility they show in not taking public credit for their contributions to this great academy - and my department in particular - are a sign of dedication to pure scientific advancement. Truly, it is a noble undertaking."

[Line 11026] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekAltWrapup4a:"Are you sure you can't tell me?" ]

[Line 11027] [Option Selected: "Are you sure you can't tell me?"]
"Alas." He shakes his head, "It would be unthinkable."

[Line 11028] [Option Selected: "Who is your patron? If they're so wealthy, I'm sure I've heard of them."]
"Mm," he frowns, carefully maintaining a thoughtful expression.
"They have asked me not to reveal their identity. I believe, if anything, the humility they show in not taking public credit for their contributions to this great academy - and my department in particular - are a sign of dedication to pure scientific advancement. Truly, it is a noble undertaking."
He lets only a moment pass. "Not unlike your own refusal to accept payment - a brave, unexpected act."

[Line 11028] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekAltWrapUp0:"I feel they are a kindred spirit. Indeed, are not we three all?"]

[Line 11029] He chuckles softly to himself, looking pleased. "I'm not sure the Director would quite agree, she is..." Elek looks upward, as if to the stars, putting forward a thoughtful expression. "She is a woman of great vision, far greater than I would have expected from a lofty position in such an ostensibly profit-driven enterprise."
"By revealing what I have to you, captain, I am trusting in your discretion," he says with a solemn nod. "I dare not say more, for Tri-"
His mouth shuts and he looks intently at you. Hoping that you didn't hear the obvious.

[Line 11029] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekAltWrapupTT2a:"I shall say nothing, of course."
gaDHO_visitElekAltWrapupTT2b:"Tri-Tachyon is backing your project?"]

[Line 11030] [Option Selected: "I shall say nothing, of course."]
"Good. That's... very good of you, captain." An extra wrinkle remains on his forehead.

[Line 11031] [Option Selected: "Tri-Tachyon is backing your project?"]
"I, um. Don't be absurd! I could have been starting to say any number of words."
He doesn't look confident.

[Line 11031] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekAltWrapupTT2c:"I shall say nothing, of course." (lie)
gaDHO_visitElekAltWrapupTT2a:"I shall say nothing, of course."]

[Line 11033] [Option Selected: "I feel they are a kindred spirit. Indeed, are not we three all?"]
"Indeed," he gives a tight smile, not taking the bait.

[Line 11034] Option(s) Selected: ['gaDHO_visitElekAltWrapup4a']
"Regardless," he sweeps his arm, "You have the opportunity of a lifetime before you - with your capabilities, you can travel to those coordinates deep in the Abyss and discover its secrets."
"Just... bring me back a record of what you find." Elek's eyes are fixed on you now, greedily.
"Recordings, telemetry, deep scans. A series of high-energy events happened there over 200 cycles ago, and these sort of phenomena simply don't occur on their own on these lone planetoids."

[Line 11034] [Options Given: gaDHO_visitElekAltEnd:Continue]

[Line 11035] [Option Selected: Continue]
His gaze wanders off toward abstraction.
"Spontaneous eruption of a hyperspace dark-matter agglomeration upon interaction with a gravity well at sufficient velocity? A simple collision between celestial bodies? It would be an astoundingly rare event - one in a billion cycles..."
Academician Elek begins to lose himself in hypothetical scenarios, mapping them into his holodisplay and comparing simulated interactions with the dataset you provided.
His vision is bound to the walls of his ivory torus - while yours may soon look upon that which lies at the heart of this mystery, in the darkness beyond the dark.

You're not sure Elek even noticed you leave.

gaDHO talk to Academician Cornelius Elek during the mission
NOT $global.gaDHO_foundArrayFirst
------------------------------
[Line 11038] "Yes? Aren't you going to the sensor array? I don't see how there can be any confusion about what I asked you to do."

[Line 11039] "Ah, greetings $playerName!" Elek looks the happiest you've ever seen him.
"I am most eager to learn of your discoveries in the Abyss- perhaps you could summarize them to me while your mission data is transferred." He taps at a datapad, "I've opened a stream."
He awaits your reply, smiling.

[Line 11039] [Options Given: gaDHO_elekGoToLocation2:"I haven't actually gone to the rogue planet yet."]

[Line 11040] [Option Selected: "I haven't actually gone to the rogue planet yet."]
"What?" He's still smiling, but his joy is fading. "Why not? Did you need to pick up more fuel and supplies? Surely the Galatia system doesn't have the best prices..."
The smile has faded by now.
"Regardless, there's no need to check in with me. Go, get moving! I await your results with the utmost anticipation. And, in the meantime, I'm a very busy man. Good day."
He turns as he cuts the comms.

[Line 11040] [Options Given: cutCommLink:Cut the comm link]

Adonya Coureuse followup

[Line 11043] [Options Given: 100:devAdonya_visOption2:DEV make Adonya visible in comm directory]

[Line 11044] [Option Selected: DEV make Adonya visible in comm directory]
Done

[Line 11045] It takes a few minutes for the comms answer.
Adonya appears, flustered. "Y-yes, hello? Who is this on comms?"
You can hear the babble of holo-entertainment over the link.

[Line 11046] [Options Given: adonya_aboutScylla1:"I'm calling about your daughter, Scylla."]

[Line 11047] [Option Selected: "I'm calling about your daughter, Scylla."]
"Oh, you're the officer from Fleet, aren't you," she says, misidentifying you.
"Did you find Scylla? You Fleet people haven't told me anything useful at all. It makes me wonder what my taxes are going toward, to be perfectly honest."

[Line 11048] [Options Given: adonya_moreHolos:"Comms more often? She's been in contact? But you said..."]

[Line 11049] [Options Given: adonya_importantToFind:"I don't think I've emphasized how important it is for me to find Scylla and Elissa."]

[Line 11050] [Options Given: adonya_importantToFind2:"It's extremely important. The fate of the Persean Sector is at stake!"]

[Line 11051] [Options Given: adonya_notFleet:"I'm not from Fleet, ma'am. I run an independent operation."]

[Line 11052] [Options Given: adonya_tell:"I found Scylla on Laicaille Habitat, then..." (explain)]

[Line 11053] [Options Given: adonya_tellStraight:"Scylla was being held by League intelligence on Laicaille Habitat." (explain)]

[Line 11054] [Options Given: adonya_outA:"Wonderful. Well, I shouldn't take any more of your time..."]

[Line 11055] [Options Given: adonya_outB:"I need to get back to my $shipOrFleet. Goodbye."]

[Line 11056] [Option Selected: "I'm not from Fleet, ma'am. I run an independent operation."]
"Oh... isn't that nice." She smiles. "You must be very successful."

[Line 11057] [Option Selected: "I found Scylla on Laicaille Habitat, then..." (explain)]
You explain that you found Scylla on Laicalle Habitat and helped her initiate a very important project at the Galatia Academy.

[Line 11058] Option(s) Selected: ['adonya_tell']
With Zal's assistance, Scylla helped Provost Baird develop a method to open the Gate System.
It was a high-pressure project, and dangerous. Not for her, of course. Her job was on the theory and numbers side. Adonya nods, an extra wrinkle of concern on her forehead.
It didn't quite work out as expected, you explain, however you did manage to make history by using the so-called Janus Device to traverse the Gates, the first such trip in over 200 cycles. And it was made possible through Elissa Zal's engineering based on theoretical developments by Academician Scylla Coureuse.

[Line 11058] [Options Given: adonya_tell3:Continue]

[Line 11059] [Option Selected: Continue]
"Oh!" Adonya lights up at your words. "I'm so happy she found Elissa again, what a nice girl. A little strange, though. Always up to something. But that's my Scylla."
"I think she gets her taste from me," Adonya says in a  conspiratorial half-whisper.
"You should have met her father! You'd have liked him, I think. Stars above, he could be a troublemaker. But he was fun," she nods to herself.

[Line 11059] [Options Given: adonya_tell4a:"And, um, that's all there is to tell."
adonya_tell4b:"And then Scylla and Zal disappeared. I don't know where to."
adonya_tell4c:"Then they disappeared together. I'm trying to find them."]

[Line 11060] [Option Selected: "And, um, that's all there is to tell."]
"Oh, okay," she says.

[Line 11061] [Option Selected: "And then Scylla and Zal disappeared. I don't know where to."]
"Oh, okay," she says, unconcerned.

[Line 11062] [Option Selected: "Then they disappeared together. I'm trying to find them."]
"Oh," she says, apparently unconcerned. "Good luck."

[Line 11063] Option(s) Selected: ['adonya_tell4a'];['adonya_tell4b'];['adonya_tell4c']
"Thank you for stopping by, captain. I know you must be very busy and an old woman's worries are probably the last thing on your mind, but it was good of you to take the time."
She pauses for a moment. "If you find her, tell her she could send comms more often. I do so love hearing from her."

[Line 11064] [Option Selected: "Comms more often? She's been in contact? But you said..."]
"Of course," she says. "Scylla is a good daughter."
"Sometimes it's a long time between them, and I get worried." She glances back toward her holotainment unit. "It'd be nice if she came for a visit."

[Line 11067] Option(s) Selected: ['adonya_outA'];['adonya_outB']
"Now you be careful out there," she says. "I know you're young, but you're not immortal. And I heard on the holo all about these terrible pirates who..."
Her impression of what happens between the Fringe and Core is somehow both ridiculously exaggerated and entirely insufficient. The holo-networks of Fikenhild are famously more entertaining than informative.
Eventually you manage to extract yourself from the comms-link.

[Line 11068] [Option Selected: "I don't think I've emphasized how important it is for me to find Scylla and Elissa."]
"I know, dear, you already mentioned it," she says.

[Line 11069] [Option Selected: "It's extremely important. The fate of the Persean Sector is at stake!"]
"Of course it is," she says, humoring you. "It's always the fate of the worlds with Scylla, isn't it?"
"I know this is all very important to you, captain." Her voice takes on a more incisive tone. "But if she's hiding from someone, if she's hiding from you, I'm sure it's for a good reason. And like I told Mister Siyavong when he came by, I don't know where my daughter or Elissa are - and I wouldn't tell him if I did."
She crosses her arms.
